  abstract = {We present the first cosmological parameter constraints using measurements of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN). The analysis uses a subsample of 207 spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia from the first three years of DES-SN, combined with a low-redshift sample of 122 SNe from the literature. Our ``DES-SN3YR'' result from these 329 SNe Ia is based on a series of companion analyses and improvements covering SN Ia discovery, spectroscopic selection, photometry, calibration, distance bias corrections, and evaluation of systematic uncertainties. For a flat {$\Lambda$}CDM model we find a matter density {$\Omega$}m = 0.331 {$\pm$} 0.038. For a flat wCDM model, and combining our SN Ia constraints with those from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), we find a dark energy equation of state w = -0.978 {$\pm$} 0.059, and {$\Omega$}m = 0.321 {$\pm$} 0.018. For a flat w0waCDM model, and combining probes from SN Ia, CMB and baryon acoustic oscillations, we find w0 = -0.885 {$\pm$} 0.114 and wa = -0.387 {$\pm$} 0.430. These results are in agreement with a cosmological constant and with previous constraints using SNe Ia (Pantheon, JLA).},

  abstract = {In this paper we will list a few important goals that need to be addressed in the next decade, also taking into account the current discordances between the different cosmological probes, such as the disagreement in the value of the Hubble constant \$H\_0\$, the \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$--\$S\_8\$ tension, and other less statistically significant anomalies. While these discordances can still be in part the result of systematic errors, their persistence after several years of accurate analysis strongly hints at cracks in the standard cosmological scenario and the necessity for new physics or generalisations beyond the standard model. In this paper, we focus on the \$5.0\textbackslash,\textbackslash sigma\$ tension between the \{\textbackslash it Planck\} CMB estimate of the Hubble constant \$H\_0\$ and the SH0ES collaboration measurements. After showing the \$H\_0\$ evaluations made from different teams using different methods and geometric calibrations, we list a few interesting new physics models that could alleviate this tension and discuss how the next decade's experiments will be crucial. Moreover, we focus on the tension of the \{\textbackslash it Planck\} CMB data with weak lensing measurements and redshift surveys, about the value of the matter energy density \$\textbackslash Omega\_m\$, and the amplitude or rate of the growth of structure (\$\textbackslash sigma\_8,f\textbackslash sigma\_8\$). We list a few interesting models proposed for alleviating this tension, and we discuss the importance of trying to fit a full array of data with a single model and not just one parameter at a time. Additionally, we present a wide range of other less discussed anomalies at a statistical significance level lower than the \$H\_0\$--\$S\_8\$ tensions which may also constitute hints towards new physics, and we discuss possible generic theoretical approaches that can collectively explain the non-standard nature of these signals.[Abridged]},

  abstract = {Bayesian inference in the presence of an intractable likelihood function is computationally challenging. When following a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to approximate the posterior distribution in this context, one typically either uses MCMC schemes which target the joint posterior of the parameters and some auxiliary latent variables, or pseudo-marginal Metropolis\textendash Hastings (MH) schemes. The latter mimic a MH algorithm targeting the marginal posterior of the parameters by approximating unbiasedly the intractable likelihood. However, in scenarios where the parameters and auxiliary variables are strongly correlated under the posterior and/or this posterior is multimodal, Gibbs sampling or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) will perform poorly and the pseudo-marginal MH algorithm, as any other MH scheme, will be inefficient for high dimensional parameters. We propose here an original MCMC algorithm, termed pseudo-marginal HMC, which combines the advantages of both HMC and pseudo-marginal schemes. Specifically, the pseudo-marginal HMC method is controlled by a precision parameter N , controlling the approximation of the likelihood and, for any N , it samples the marginal posterior of the parameters. Additionally, as N tends to infinity, its sample trajectories and acceptance probability converge to those of an ideal, but intractable, HMC algorithm which would have access to the marginal posterior of parameters and its gradient. We demonstrate through experiments that pseudo-marginal HMC can outperform significantly both standard HMC and pseudo-marginal MH schemes.},

  abstract = {In recent years, deep learning approaches have achieved state-of-the-art results in the analysis of point cloud data. In cosmology, galaxy redshift surveys resemble such a permutation invariant collection of positions in space. These surveys have so far mostly been analysed with two-point statistics, such as power spectra and correlation functions. The usage of these summary statistics is best justified on large scales, where the density field is linear and Gaussian. However, in light of the increased precision expected from upcoming surveys, the analysis of \textendash{} intrinsically non-Gaussian \textendash{} small angular separations represents an appealing avenue to better constrain cosmological parameters. In this work, we aim to improve upon two-point statistics by employing a PointNet-like neural network to regress the values of the cosmological parameters directly from point cloud data. Our implementation of PointNets can analyse inputs of O(104) - O(105) galaxies at a time, which improves upon earlier work for this application by roughly two orders of magnitude. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to analyse galaxy redshift survey data on the lightcone, as opposed to previously static simulation boxes at a given fixed redshift.},

  abstract = {Methods. We performed a probabilistic photo-z determination using mixture density networks (MDN). The training data set is composed of optical (griz photometric bands) point-spread-function and model magnitudes and extinction measurements from the SDSSDR15 and WISE mid-infrared (3.4 \textmu m and 4.6 \textmu m) model magnitudes. We used infinite Gaussian mixture models to classify the objects in our data set as stars, galaxies, or quasars, and to determine the number of MDN components to achieve optimal performance. Results. The fraction of objects that are correctly split into the main classes of stars, galaxies, and quasars is 94\%. Furthermore, our method improves the bias of photometric redshift estimation (i.e., the mean {$\increment$}z = (zp - zs)/(1 + zs)) by one order of magnitude compared to the SDSS photo-z, and it decreases the fraction of 3{$\sigma$} outliers (i.e., 3 \texttimes{} rms({$\increment$}z) {$<$} {$\increment$}z). The relative, root-mean-square systematic uncertainty in our resulting photo-zs is down to 1.7\% for benchmark samples of low-redshift galaxies (zs {$<$} 0.5). Conclusions. We have demonstrated the feasibility of machine-learning-based methods that produce full probability distributions for photo-z estimates with a performance that is competitive with state-of-the art techniques. Our method can be applied to wide-field surveys where extinction can vary significantly across the sky and with sparse spectroscopic calibration samples. The code is publicly available.},

  abstract = {We present a sample of 485 photometrically identified Type Ia supernova candidates mined from the first three years of data of the CFHT SuperNova Legacy Survey (SNLS). The images were submitted to a deferred processing independent of the SNLS real-time detection pipeline. Light curves of all transient events were reconstructed in the gM , rM , iM and zM filters and submitted to automated sequential cuts in order to identify possible supernovae. Pure noise and long-term variable events were rejected by light curve shape criteria. Type Ia supernova identification relied on event characteristics fitted to their light curves assuming the events to be normal SNe Ia. The light curve fitter SALT2 was used for this purpose, assigning host galaxy photometric redshifts to the tested events. The selected sample of 485 candidates is one magnitude deeper than that allowed by the SNLS spectroscopic identification. The contamination by supernovae of other types is estimated to be 4\%. Testing Hubble diagram residuals with this enlarged sample allows us to measure the Malmquist bias due to spectroscopic selections directly. The result is fully consistent with the precise Monte Carlo based estimate used to correct SN Ia distance moduli in the SNLS 3-year cosmological analyses. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of a photometric selection of high redshift supernovae with known host galaxy redshifts, opening interesting prospects for cosmological analyses from future large photometric SN Ia surveys.},

The method is constrained by galaxies' observed stellar mass functions, SFRs (specific and cosmic), quenched fractions, UV luminosity functions, UV\textendash stellar mass relations, IRX\textendash UV relations, auto- and cross-correlation functions (including quenched and star-forming subsamples), and quenching dependence on environment; each observable is reproduced over the full redshift range available, up to 0 {$<$} z {$<$} 10. Key findings include: galaxy assembly correlates strongly with halo assembly; quenching correlates strongly with halo mass; quenched fractions at fixed halo mass decrease with increasing redshift; massive quenched galaxies reside in higher-mass haloes than star-forming galaxies at fixed galaxy mass; star-forming and quenched galaxies' star formation histories at fixed mass differ most at z {$<$} 0.5; satellites have large scatter in quenching timescales after infall, and have modestly higher quenched fractions than central galaxies; Planck cosmologies result in up to 0.3 dex lower stellar\textemdash halo mass ratios at early times; and, nonetheless, stellar mass\textendash halo mass ratios rise at z {$>$} 5. Also presented are revised stellar mass\textemdash halo mass relations for all, quenched, star-forming, central, and satellite galaxies; the dependence of star formation histories on halo mass, stellar mass, and galaxy SSFR; quenched fractions and quenching timescale distributions for satellites; and predictions for higher-redshift galaxy correlation functions and weak lensing surface densities.

  abstract = {Methods. We have devised a Bayesian hierarchical inference framework that enables the determination of all lensing parameters and the scaling relation hyperparameters, including intrinsic scatter, from lensing constraints and (if given) stellar kinematic measurements. We achieve this through BayesLens, a purpose-built wrapper around common parametric lensing codes that can sample the full posterior on parameters and hyperparameters, which we release with this paper. Results. We have run functional tests of our code against simple mock cluster lensing data-sets with realistic uncertainties. The parameters and hyperparameters are recovered within their 68\% credibility ranges and the positions of all the ``observed'' multiple images are accurately reproduced by the BayeLens best-fit model, without over-fitting. Conclusions. We have shown that an accurate description of cluster member galaxies is attainable, despite a large number of degrees of freedom, through fast and tractable inference. This extends beyond the state-of-the-art of current cluster lensing models. The precise impact on studies of cosmography, galaxy evolution, and high-redshift galaxy populations can then be quantified on real galaxy clusters. While other sources of systematics exist and may be significant in real clusters, our results show that the contribution of intrinsic scatter in cluster member populations can now be controlled.},

We specifically reconstructed the sub-halo mass component with robust stellar kinematics information of cluster galaxies, in combination with precise strong lensing models based on large samples of spectroscopically identified multiple images. We used integral-field spectroscopy in the cluster cores, from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer on the Very Large Telescope, to measure the stellar velocity dispersion, {$\sigma$}, of 40-60 member galaxies per cluster, covering four to five magnitudes to mF160W 21.5. We verified the robustness and quantified the accuracy of the velocity dispersion measurements with extensive spectral simulations. With these data, we determined the normalization and slope of the galaxy L\textendash{$\sigma$} Faber\textendash Jackson relation in each cluster and used these parameters as a prior for the scaling relations of the sub-halo population in the mass distribution modeling. When compared to our previous lens models, the inclusion of member galaxies' kinematics provides a similar precision in reproducing the positions of the multiple images. However, the inherent degeneracy between the central effective velocity dispersion, {$\sigma$}0, and truncation radius, rcut, of sub-halos is strongly reduced, thus significantly alleviating possible systematics in the measurements of sub-halo masses. The three independent determinations of the {$\sigma$}0-rcut scaling relation in each cluster are found to be fully consistent, enabling a statistical determination of sub-halo sizes as a function of {$\sigma$}0, or halo masses. Finally, we derived the galaxy central velocity dispersion functions of the three clusters projected within 16\% of their virial radius, finding that they are well in agreement with each other. We argue that such a methodology, when applied to high-quality kinematics and strong lensing data, allows the sub-halo mass functions to be determined and compared with those obtained from cosmological simulations.},

We spectroscopically identify 182 multiple images from 48 background sources at 0.9 {$<$} z {$<$} 6.2, and 171 cluster member galaxies. Several multiple images are associated to individual clumps in multiply lensed resolved sources. By defining a new metric, which is sensitive to the gradients of the deflection field, we show that we can accurately reproduce the positions of these star-forming knots despite their vicinity to the model critical lines. The high signal-to-noise ratio of the MDLF spectra enables the measurement of the internal velocity dispersion of 64 cluster galaxies, down to mF160W = 22. This allowed us to independently estimate the contribution of the subhalo mass component of the lens model from the measured Faber-Jackson scaling relation. Our best reference model, which represents a significant step forward compared to our previous analyses, was selected from a comparative study of different mass parametrizations. The root-mean-square displacement between the observed and model-predicted image positions is only 0.40 , which is 33\% smaller than in all previous models. The mass model appears to be particularly well constrained in the MDLF region. We characterize the robustness of the magnification map at varying distances from the model critical lines and the total projected mass profile of the cluster.},

  abstract = {{$\blacksquare$} Abstract\hspace{0.6em} Standard star photometry dominated the latter half of the twentieth century reaching its zenith in the 1980s. It was introduced to take advantage of the high sensitivity and large dynamic range of photomultiplier tubes compared to photographic plates. As the quantum efficiency of photodetectors improved and the wavelength range extended further to the red, standard systems were modified and refined, and deviations from the original systems proliferated. The revolutionary shift to area detectors for all optical and IR observations forced further changes to standard systems, and the precision and accuracy of much broad- and intermediate-band photometry suffered until more suitable observational techniques and standard reduction procedures were adopted. But the biggest revolution occurred with the production of all-sky photometric surveys. Hipparcos/Tycho was space based, but most, like 2MASS, were ground-based, dedicated survey telescopes. It is very likely that in the future, rather than making a measurement of an object in some standard photometric system, one will simply look up the magnitudes and colors of most objects in catalogs accessed from the Virtual Observatory. In this review the history of standard star photometry will be outlined, and the calibration and realization of standard systems will be examined. Finally, model atmosphere fluxes are now very realistic, and synthetic photometry offers the best prospects for calibrating all photometric systems. Synthetic photometry from observed spectrophotometry should also be used as a matter of course to provide colors within standard systems and to gain insights into the spectra and colors of unusual stars, star clusters and distant galaxies.},

  abstract = {The extragalactic distance scale is fundamental to our understanding of astrophysics and cosmology. In recent years, the surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) method, applied in the near-IR, has proven especially powerful for measuring galaxy distances, first with HST and now with a new JWST program to calibrate the method directly from the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB). So far, however, the distances from space have been gathered slowly, one or two at a time. With the Roman Space Telescope, we have the opportunity to measure uniformly high-quality SBF distances to thousands of galaxies out to hundreds of Mpc. The impact of these data on cosmology and galaxy studies depends on the specifics of the survey, including the filter selection, exposure depth, and (especially) the sky coverage. While the baseline HLWAS survey in four filters plus the grism would yield useful data, the impact would be limited by the relatively small area. A more optimal approach would concentrate on the most efficient passband (F146), adopt an exposure time sufficient to measure good quality distances well out into the Hubble flow (z 0.03), and then maximize the sky coverage within the total time constraints. Grism observations over the same area can provide the needed information on redshifts and spectral energy distributions for compact sources, while colors for larger objects can be obtained from lower resolution surveys. The proposed plan will enable accurate determination of the physical properties of thousands of nearby galaxies, an independent measure of the Hubble constant H0 with negligible statistical error, and competitive constraints on S8 = {$\sigma$}8({$\Omega$}m/0.3)0.5. The resulting data set will be a phenomenal resource for a wide range of studies in astrophysics and cosmology.},

Shock energy deposited in the envelope of any exploding primary contributes to the early SN brightness and, since this radiation energy is degraded by expansion after the explosion, the diffusive luminosity depends on the initial primary radius. We present a new non-detection limit of the nearby SN Ia 2011fe, obtained what appears to be just 4 hours after explosion, allowing us to directly constrain the initial primary radius, Rp. Coupled with the non-detection of a quiescent X-ray counterpart and the inferred synthesized 56Ni mass, we show that Rp {$\sim<$} 0.02R (a factor of 5 smaller than previously inferred), that the average density of the primary must be {$\rho$}p {$>$} 104 gm cm-3, and that the effective temperature must be less than a few \texttimes 105 K. This rules out hydrogen burning main sequence stars and giants. Constructing the helium-burning main sequence and carbon-burning main sequence, we find such objects are also excluded. By process of elimination, we find that only degeneracy-supported compact objects\textemdash WDs and neutron stars\textemdash are viable as the primary star of SN 2011fe. With few caveats, we also restrict the companion (secondary) star radius to Rc {$\sim<$} 0.1 R , excluding Roche-Lobe overflowing red giant and main-sequence companions to high significance.},

  abstract = {Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) are standardizable candles that allow us to measure the recent expansion rate of the Universe. Due to uncertainties in progenitor physics, potential astrophysical dependencies may bias cosmological measurements if not properly accounted for. The dependency of the intrinsic luminosity of SNe Ia with their host-galaxy environment is often used to standardize SNe Ia luminosity and is commonly parameterized as a step function. This functional form implicitly assumes two-populations of SNe Ia. In the literature, multiple environmental indicators have been considered, finding different, sometimes incompatible, step function amplitudes. We compare these indicators in the context of a two-populations model, based on their ability to distinguish the two populations. We show that local H{$\alpha$}-based specific star formation rate (lsSFR) and global stellar mass are better tracers than, for instance, host galaxy morphology. We show that tracer accuracy can explain the discrepancy between the observed SNe Ia step amplitudes found in the literature. Using lsSFR or global mass to identify the two populations can explain all other observations, though lsSFR is favoured. As lsSFR is strongly connected to age, our results favour a prompt and delayed population model. In any case, there exists two populations that differ in standardized magnitude by at least 0.121 {$\pm$} 0.010 mag.},

  abstract = {The use of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) as cosmological tools has motivated significant effort to: understand what drives the intrinsic scatter of SN Ia distance modulus residuals after standardization, characterize the distribution of SN Ia colors, and explain why properties of the host galaxies of the SNe correlate with SN Ia distance modulus residuals. We use a compiled sample of {$\sim$} 1450 spectroscopically confirmed, photometric light-curves of SN Ia and propose a solution to these three problems simultaneously that also explains an empirical 11{$\sigma$} detection of the dependence of Hubble residual scatter on SN Ia color. We introduce a physical model of color where intrinsic SN Ia colors with a relatively weak correlation with luminosity are combined with extrinsic dust-like colors (E(B - V )) with a wide range of extinction parameter values (RV ). This model captures the observed trends of Hubble residual scatter and indicates that the dominant component of SN Ia intrinsic scatter is from variation in RV . We also find that the recovered E(B - V ) and RV distributions differ based on global host-galaxy stellar mass and this explains the observed correlation ({$\gamma$}) between mass and Hubble residuals seen in past analyses as well as an observed 4.5{$\sigma$} dependence of {$\gamma$} on SN Ia color. This finding removes any need to prescribe different intrinsic luminosities to different progenitor systems. Finally we measure biases in the equation-of-state of dark energy (w) up to |{$\increment$}w| = 0.04 by replacing previous models of SN color with our dust-based model; this bias is larger than any systematic uncertainty in previous SN Ia cosmological analyses.},

  abstract = {We present constraints on cosmological parameters from the Pantheon+ analysis of 1701 light curves of 1550 distinct Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) ranging in redshift from z = 0.001 to 2.26. This work features an increased sample size, increased redshift span, and improved treatment of systematic uncertainties in comparison to the original Pantheon analysis and results in a factor of 2 improvement in cosmological constraining power. For a Flat{$\Lambda$}CDM model, we find {$\Omega$}M = 0.338 {$\pm$} 0.018 from SNe Ia alone. For a Flatw0CDM model, we measure w0 = -0.89 {$\pm$} 0.13 from SNe Ia alone, H0 = 72.86-+01..9046 km s-1 Mpc-1 when including the Cepheid host distances and covariance (SH0ES), and w0 = -0.978+-00..002341 when combining the SN likelihood with constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO); both w0 values are consistent with a cosmological constant. We also present the most precise measurements to date on the evolution of dark energy in a Flatw0waCDM universe, and measure wa = -0.4+-11..08 from Pantheon+ alone, H0 = 73.40-+01..9292 km s-1 Mpc-1 when including SH0ES, and wa = -0.65+-00..2382 when combining Pantheon+ with CMB and BAO data. Finally, we find that systematic uncertainties in the use of SNe Ia along the distance ladder comprise less than one third of the total uncertainty in the measurement of H0 and cannot explain the present ``Hubble tension'' between local measurements and early-Universe predictions from the cosmological model.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            We present a recalibration of the photometric systems in the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) including those in the SH0ES distance-ladder measurement of               H               0               . We utilize the large and uniform sky coverage of the public Pan-STARRS stellar photometry catalog to cross calibrate against tertiary standards released by individual SN Ia surveys. The most significant updates over the ``SuperCal'' cross calibration used for the previous Pantheon and SH0ES analyses are: (1) expansion of the number of photometric systems (now 25) and filters (now 105), (2) solving for all filter offsets in all systems simultaneously to produce a calibration uncertainty covariance matrix for cosmological-model constraints, and (3) accounting for the change in the fundamental flux calibration of the Hubble Space Telescope CALSPEC standards from previous versions on the order of 1.5\% over a {$\Delta$}               {$\lambda$}               of 4000 \AA. We retrain the SALT2 model and find that our new model coupled with the new calibration of the light curves themselves causes a net distance modulus change (               d               {$\mu$}               /               dz               ) of 0.04 mag over the redshift range 0 {$<$}               z               {$<$} 1. We introduce a new formalism to determine the systematic impact on cosmological inference by propagating the covariance in the fitted calibration offsets through retraining simultaneously with light-curve fitting and find a total calibration uncertainty impact of               {$\sigma$}                                w                              = 0.013; roughly half the size of the sample statistical uncertainty. Similarly, we find the systematic SN calibration contribution to the SH0ES               H               0               uncertainty is less than 0.2 km s               -1               Mpc               -1               , suggesting that SN Ia calibration cannot resolve the current level of the ``Hubble Tension.''},

Its strengths are the unsupervised navigation of complex, potentially multi-modal posteriors until a well-defined termination point. A systematic literature review of nested sampling algorithms and variants is presented. We focus on complete algorithms, including solutions to likelihood-restricted prior sampling, parallelisation, termination and diagnostics. The relation between number of live points, dimensionality and computational cost is studied for two complete algorithms. A new formulation of NS is presented, which casts the parameter space exploration as a search on a tree data structure. Previously published ways of obtaining robust error estimates and dynamic variations of the number of live points are presented as special cases of this formulation. A new online diagnostic test is presented based on previous insertion rank order work. The survey of nested sampling methods concludes with outlooks for future research.},

To zeroth order, we show that all these masses can be expressed in terms of either the Planck mass or the Chandrasekar mass, in combination with various dimensionless quantities.

MUSE observations enable the spectroscopic identification of 23 new multiply imaged sources, extending the previous compilations by a factor of approximately five. In total, we use the positional measurements of 82 spectroscopic multiple images belonging to 27 families at z = 1.0-6.1 to reconstruct the projected total mass distribution of MACS 1206. Remarkably, 11 multiple images are found within 50 kpc of the brightest cluster galaxy, making this an unprecedented set of constraints for the innermost projected mass distribution of a galaxy cluster. We thus find that, although dynamically relaxed, the smooth matter component (dark matter plus hot gas) of MACS 1206 shows a significant asymmetry, which closely follows the asymmetric distribution of the stellar component (galaxy members and intracluster light). We determine the value of the innermost logarithmic slope of the projected total mass density profile and find it to be close to the canonical Navarro-Frenk-White value. We demonstrate that this quantity is very robust against different parametrizations of the diffuse mass component; however, this is not the case when only one central image is used in the mass reconstruction. We also show that the mass density profile from our new strong lensing model is in very good agreement with dynamical and X-ray measurements at larger radii, where they overlap.},

The observed positions of the multiple images of strongly lensed background sources were used to constrain parametric models describing the cluster total mass distributions. Different models were tested in each cluster depending on the complexity of its mass distribution and on the number of detected multiple images. Four clusters show more than five spectroscopically confirmed multiple image families. In this sample, we did not make use of families that are only photometrically identified in order to reduce model degeneracies between the values of the total mass of a cluster source redshifts, in addition to systematics due to the potential misidentifications of multiple images. For the remaining four clusters, we used additional families without any spectroscopic confirmation to increase the number of strong lensing constraints up to the number of free parameters in our parametric models. We present spectroscopic confirmation of 27 multiply lensed sources, with no previous spectroscopic measurements, spanning over the redshift range of zsrc = [0.7-6.1]. Moreover, we confirm an average of 48 galaxy members in the core of each cluster thanks to the high efficiency and large field of view of MUSE. We used this information to derive precise strong lensing models, projected total mass distributions, and magnification maps. We show that, despite having different properties (i.e. number of mass components, total mass, redshift, etc.), the projected total mass and mass density profiles of all clusters have very similar shapes when rescaled by independent measurements of M200c and R200c. Specifically, we measured the mean value of the projected total mass of our cluster sample within 10 (20)\% of R200c to be 0.13 (0.32) of M200c, with a remarkably small scatter of 5 (6)\%. Furthermore, the large number of high-z sources and the precise magnification maps derived in this work for four clusters add up to the sample of high-quality gravitational telescopes to be used to study the faint and distant Universe.},

  abstract = {We present jax-cosmo, a library for automatically differentiable cosmological theory calculations. jax-cosmo uses the JAX library, which has created a new coding ecosystem, especially in probabilistic programming. As well as batch acceleration, just-in-time compilation, and automatic optimization of code for different hardware modalities (CPU, GPU, TPU), JAX exposes an automatic differentiation (autodiff) mechanism. Thanks to autodiff, jax-cosmo gives access to the derivatives of cosmological likelihoods with respect to any of their parameters, and thus enables a range of powerful Bayesian inference algorithms, otherwise impractical in cosmology, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Variational Inference. In its initial release, jax-cosmo implements background evolution, linear and non-linear power spectra (using halofit or the Eisenstein and Hu transfer function), as well as angular power spectra (C ) with the Limber approximation for galaxy and weak lensing probes, all differentiable with respect to the cosmological parameters and their other inputs. We illustrate how automatic differentiation can be a game-changer for common tasks involving Fisher matrix computations, or full posterior inference with gradient-based techniques (e.g. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo). In particular, we show how Fisher matrices are now fast, exact, no longer require any fine tuning, and are themselves differentiable with respect to parameters of the likelihood, enabling complex survey optimization by simple gradient descent. Finally, using a Dark Energy Survey Year 1 3x2pt analysis as a benchmark, we demonstrate how jax-cosmo can be combined with Probabilistic Programming Languages such as NumPyro to perform posterior inference with state-of-the-art algorithms including a No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI), and Neural Transport HMC (NeuTra). We show that thee effective sample size per node (1 GPU or 32 CPUs) per hour of wall time is about 5 times better for a JAX NUTS sampler compared to the well optimized Cobaya Metropolis-Hasting sampler. We further demonstrate that Normalizing Flows using Neural Transport are a promising methodology for model validation in the early stages of analysis.},

  abstract = {Pan-STARRS1 has carried out a set of distinct synoptic imaging sky surveys including the 3{$\pi$} Steradian Survey and the Medium Deep Survey in 5 bands (grizyP1). The mean 5{$\sigma$} point source limiting sensitivities in the stacked 3{$\pi$} Steradian Survey in grizyP 1 are (23.3, 23.2, 23.1, 22.3, 21.4) respectively. The upper bound on the systematic uncertainty in the photometric calibration across the sky is 7-12 millimag depending on the bandpass. The systematic uncertainty of the astrometric calibration using the Gaia frame comes from a comparison of the results with Gaia: the standard deviation of the mean and median residuals ({$\increment$}ra, {$\increment$}dec ) are (2.3, 1.7) milliarcsec, and (3.1, 4.8) milliarcsec respectively. The Pan-STARRS system and the design of the PS1 surveys are described and an overview of the resulting image and catalog data products and their basic characteristics are described together with a summary of important results. The images, reduced data products, and derived data products from the Pan-STARRS1 surveys are available to the community from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) at STScI.},

Data collected by CHIME over 88 days in the 400 - 500 MHz frequency band (1.8 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.5) are formed into maps of the sky and high-pass delay filtered to suppress the foreground power, corresponding to removing cosmological scales with k{$\parallel$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.13 Mpc-1 at the average redshift. Line-of-sight spectra to the eBOSS background quasar locations are extracted from the CHIME maps and combined with the Lyman-{$\alpha$} forest flux transmission spectra to estimate the 21 cm-Lyman-{$\alpha$} cross-correlation function. Fitting a simulationderived template function to this measurement results in a 9{$\sigma$} detection significance. The coherent accumulation of the signal through cross-correlation is sufficient to enable a detection despite excess variance from foreground residuals {$\sim$} 6 - 10 times brighter than the expected thermal noise level in the correlation function.

  abstract = {We present results from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) photometric redshift methods investigation. In this investigation, the results from 11 participants, each using a different combination of photometric redshift code, template spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and priors, are used to examine the properties of photometric redshifts applied to deep fields with broadband multi-wavelength coverage. The photometry used includes U-band through mid-infrared filters and was derived using the TFIT method. Comparing the results, we find that there is no particular code or set of template SEDs that results in significantly better photometric redshifts compared to others. However, we find that codes producing the lowest scatter and outlier fraction utilize a training sample to optimize photometric redshifts by adding zero-point offsets, template adjusting, or adding extra smoothing errors. These results therefore stress the importance of the training procedure. We find a strong dependence of the photometric redshift accuracy on the signal-to-noise ratio of the photometry. On the other hand, we find a weak dependence of the photometric redshift scatter with redshift and galaxy color. We find that most photometric redshift codes quote redshift errors (e.g., 68\% confidence intervals) that are too small compared to that expected from the spectroscopic control sample. We find that all codes show a statistically significant bias in the photometric redshifts. However, the bias is in all cases smaller than the scatter; the latter therefore dominates the errors. Finally, we find that combining results from multiple codes significantly decreases the photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction. We discuss different ways of combining data to produce accurate photometric redshifts and error estimates.},

We have defined a sample of 983 Quasars up to {$\mathsl{z}$} = 7.54 with reduced intrinsic dispersion {$\mathsl{\delta}$} = 0.007 which determines the matter density parameter {$\Omega\mathsl{M}$} with the same precision of SNe Ia. Although previous analysis have been used Quasars as cosmological tools (e.g. Risaliti and Lusso 2019), this is the first time that high-redshift sources, in this case Quasars, as standalone cosmological probes yield such tight constraints on {$\Omega\mathsl{M}$} . Our results show the importance of correcting cosmological relationships for selection biases and redshift evolution and how the choice of a golden sample reduces considerably the intrinsic scatter. This proves the reliability of Quasars as standard cosmological candles.},

  abstract = {Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) are considered the most reliable standard candles and they have played an invaluable role in cosmology since the discovery of the Universe's accelerated expansion. During the last decades, the SNe Ia samples have been improved in number, redshift coverage, calibration methodology, and systematics treatment. These efforts led to the most recent ``Pantheon" (2018) and ``Pantheon +" (2022) releases, which enable to constrain cosmological parameters more precisely than previous samples. In this era of precision cosmology, the community strives to find new ways to reduce uncertainties on cosmological parameters. To this end, we start our investigation even from the likelihood assumption of Gaussianity, implicitly used in this domain. Indeed, the usual practise involves constraining parameters through a Gaussian distance moduli likelihood. This method relies on the implicit assumption that the difference between the distance moduli measured and the ones expected from the cosmological model is Gaussianly distributed. In this work, we test this hypothesis for both the Pantheon and Pantheon + releases. We find that in both cases this requirement is not fulfilled and the actual underlying distributions are a logistic and a Student's t distribution for the Pantheon and Pantheon + data, respectively. When we apply these new likelihoods fitting a flat {$\Lambda$}CDM model, we significantly reduce the uncertainties on {$\Omega\mathsl{M}$} and {$\mathsl{H}$}0 of {$\sim$} 40\%. This boosts the SNe Ia power in constraining cosmological parameters, thus representing a huge step forward to shed light on the current debated tensions in cosmology.},

  abstract = {The use of multiple independent methods with their own systematic uncertainties is crucial for resolving the ongoing tension between local and distant measurements of the Hubble constant (H0). While type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have historically been the most widely used distance indicators, recent studies have shown that type II supernovae (SNe II) can provide independent measurements of extragalactic distances with different systematic uncertainties. Unlike SNe Ia, the progenitors of SNe II are well understood, arising from the explosion of red supergiants in late-type galaxies via core-collapse. While SNe II do not exhibit the same level of uniformity in peak luminosity as SNe Ia, their differences can be calibrated using theoretical or empirical methods. Overall, this chapter presents a comprehensive overview of the use of SNe II as extragalactic distance indicators, with a particular focus on their application to measuring H0 and addressing the Hubble tension. We describe the underlying theory of each method, discuss the challenges associated with them, including uncertainties in the calibration of the supernova absolute magnitude, and present a comprehensive list of the most updated Hubble constant measurements.},

Our standard sample consists of 404 SNe Ia with {$\mathsl{m}$}V,peak {$<$} 17 mag and Galactic latitude |{$\mathsl{b}$}| {$>$} 15{$\smwhtcircle$}. Our results are both statistically more precise and systematically more robust than previous studies due to the large sample size and high spectroscopic completeness. We make completeness corrections based on both the apparent and absolute magnitudes by simulating the detection of SNe Ia in ASAS-SN light curves. We find a total volumetric rate for all sub-types of {$\mathsl{R}$}tot = 2.28+-00..2200 \texttimes{} 104 yr-1 Gpc-3 {$\Planckconst$}370 for {$\mathsl{M}$}V,peak {$<$} -16.5 mag ({$\mathsl{R}$}tot = 1.91+-00..1122 \texttimes{} 104 yr-1 Gpc-3 {$\Planckconst$}370 for {$\mathsl{M}$}V,peak {$<$} -17.5 mag) at the median redshift of our sample, {$\mathsl{z}$}med = 0.024.

  abstract = {We study a variant of the variational autoencoder model (VAE) with a Gaussian mixture as a prior distribution, with the goal of performing unsupervised clustering through deep generative models. We observe that the known problem of over-regularisation that has been shown to arise in regular VAEs also manifests itself in our model and leads to cluster degeneracy. We show that a heuristic called minimum information constraint that has been shown to mitigate this effect in VAEs can also be applied to improve unsupervised clustering performance with our model. Furthermore we analyse the effect of this heuristic and provide an intuition of the various processes with the help of visualizations. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our model on synthetic data, MNIST and SVHN, showing that the obtained clusters are distinct, interpretable and result in achieving competitive performance on unsupervised clustering to the state-of-the-art results.},

With the improvement of the number and the accuracy of observations, discrepancies among key cosmological parameters of the model have emerged. The most statistically significant tension is the 4               {$\sigma$}               to 6               {$\sigma$}               disagreement between predictions of the Hubble constant,               H               0               , made by the early time probes in concert with the `vanilla' {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmological model, and a number of late time, model-independent determinations of               H               0               from local measurements of distances and redshifts. The high precision and consistency of the data at both ends present strong challenges to the possible solution space and demands a hypothesis with enough rigor to explain multiple observations\textemdash whether these invoke new physics, unexpected large-scale structures or multiple, unrelated errors. A thorough review of the problem including a discussion of recent Hubble constant estimates and a summary of the proposed theoretical solutions is presented here. We include more than 1000 references, indicating that the interest in this area has grown considerably just during the last few years. We classify the many proposals to resolve the tension in these categories: early dark energy, late dark energy, dark energy models with 6 degrees of freedom and their extensions, models with extra relativistic degrees of freedom, models with extra interactions, unified cosmologies, modified gravity, inflationary models, modified recombination history, physics of the critical phenomena, and alternative proposals. Some are formally successful, improving the fit to the data in light of their additional degrees of freedom, restoring agreement within 1\textendash 2               {$\sigma$}               between               Planck               2018, using the cosmic microwave background power spectra data, baryon acoustic oscillations, Pantheon SN data, and R20, the latest SH0ES Team Riess,               et~al               (2021               Astrophys.

However, there are many more unsuccessful models which leave the discrepancy well above the 3               {$\sigma$}               disagreement level. In many cases, reduced tension comes not simply from a change in the value of               H               0               but also due to an increase in its uncertainty due to degeneracy with additional physics, complicating the picture and pointing to the need for additional probes. While no specific proposal makes a strong case for being highly likely or far better than all others, solutions involving early or dynamical dark energy, neutrino interactions, interacting cosmologies, primordial magnetic fields, and modified gravity provide the best options until a better alternative comes along.},

We find six new runaways, including four stars with radial velocities (RVs) {$>$} 1000 km s-1 and total space velocities {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1300 km s-1. These are most likely the surviving donors from double-degenerate binaries in which the other WD exploded. The other two objects have lower minimum velocities, {$\greaterequivlnt$} 600 km s-1, and may have formed through a different mechanism, such as pure deflagration of a WD in a Type Iax supernova. The four fastest stars are hotter and smaller than the previously known ``D6 stars,'' with effective temperatures ranging from {$\sim$}20,000 to {$\sim$}130,000 K and radii of {$\sim$} 0.02\textendash 0.10 R{$\odot$}. Three of these have carbon-dominated atmospheres, and one has a helium-dominated atmosphere. Two stars have RVs of -1694 and -2285 km s-1 \textendash{} the fastest systemic stellar RVs ever measured. Their inferred birth velocities, {$\sim$} 2200\textendash 2500 km s-1, imply that both WDs in the progenitor binary had masses {$>$} 1.0 M{$\odot$}. The high observed velocities suggest that a dominant fraction of the observed hypervelocity WD population comes from double-degenerate binaries whose total mass significantly exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit. However, the two nearest and faintest D6 stars have the lowest velocities and masses, suggesting that observational selection effects favor rarer, higher-mass stars. A significant population of fainter low-mass runaways may still await discovery. We infer a birth rate of D6 stars that is consistent with the SN Ia rate. The birth rate is poorly constrained, however, because the luminosities and lifetimes of D6 stars are uncertain.},

We pay attention to the apparent preference for phantom DE from Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data alone, whose origin we study in detail and attribute to a wide range of (physical and geometrical) effects. We deem the combination of Planck CMB, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Type Ia Supernovae, and Cosmic Chronometers data to be particularly trustworthy, inferring from this final consensus dataset \$w=-1.013\^\{+0.038\}\_\{-0.043\}\$, in excellent agreement with the cosmological constant value.

  abstract = {Hierarchical Bayesian inference can simultaneously account for both measurement uncertainty and selection effects within astronomical catalogs. In particular, the hierarchy imposed encodes beliefs about the interdependence of the physical processes that generate the observed data. We show that several proposed approximations within the literature actually correspond to inferences that are incompatible with any physical detection process, which can be described by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This generically leads to biases and is associated with the assumption that detectability is independent of the observed data given the true source parameters. We show several examples of how this error can affect astrophysical inferences based on catalogs of coalescing binaries observed through gravitational waves, including misestimating the redshift evolution of the merger rate as well as incorrectly inferring that General Relativity is the correct theory of gravity when it is not. In general, one cannot directly fit for the ``detected distribution'' and ``divide out'' the selection effects in post-processing. Similarly, when comparing theoretical predictions to observations, it is better to simulate detected data (including both measurement noise and selection effects) rather than comparing estimates of the detected distributions of event parameters (which include only selection effects). While the biases introduced by model misspecification from incorrect assumptions may be smaller than statistical uncertainty for moderate catalog sizes (O(100) events), they will nevertheless pose a significant barrier to precision measurements of astrophysical populations.},

We use this sample to characterize the shapes of the early time light curves, measure the rise times from first light to peak, and search for companion star interactions. Using simulations, we show that light curves must have noise {$<$} 10\% of the peak flux to avoid biases in the early time light curve shape, restricting our quantitative analysis to 74 light curves. We find that the mean power law index t{$\beta$}1 of the early time light curves is {$\beta$}1 =1.93 {$\pm$} 0.57 and the mean rise time to peak is 15.7 {$\pm$} 3.5 days. We also estimate the underlying population distribution for {$\beta$}1 and find a Gaussian component with mean 2.29, width 0.34, and a long tail extending to values less than 1.0. We use model comparison techniques to test for the presence of companion interactions. In contrast to recent results in the literature, we find that the data can rarely distinguish between models with and without companion interaction models, and caution is needed when claiming detections of flux excesses in early time supernova light curves. Nevertheless, we find three high-quality SN light curves that tentatively prefer the addition of a companion interaction model, but the statistical evidence for the companion interactions is not robust. We also find two SNe that disfavor the addition of a companion interaction model to a curved power law model. Taking the 74 SNe together, we calculate 3{$\sigma$} upper limits on the presence of companion signatures to control for orientation effects that can hide companions in individual SN light curves. Our results rule out common progenitor systems with companions having Roche lobe radii {$>$} 31 R{$\odot$} (separations {$>$} 5.7 \texttimes{} 1012 cm, 99.9\% confidence level) and disfavor companions having Roche lobe radii {$>$} 10 R{$\odot$} (separations {$>$} 1.9 \texttimes{} 1012 cm, 95\% confidence level).

In this work, we use cosmography, a modelindependent approach to describe the evolution of the universe, to introduce the cosmographic expansion of the DM-z relation. By fitting two different models for the intergalactic medium and host contributions to a sample of 23 well-localized FRBs, we estimate the kinematic parameters {$\mathsl{q}$}0 = -0.59-+00..2107, {$\mathsl{j}$}0 = 1.08-+00..6526, {$\mathsl{s}$}0 = -2.1 {$\pm$} 7.0, and {$\mathsl{H}$}0 = 69.4 {$\pm$} 4.7 achieving a precision of 6\% and 7\% for the Hubble constant depending on the models used for contributions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this approach can be used to address the long-standing "Missing Baryons" problem in astrophysics by estimating that 82\% of the baryonic content of the universe resides in the intergalactic medium, within 7\% and 8\% precision, according to the contribution models considered here. Our findings highlight the potential of FRBs as a valuable tool in cosmological research and underscore the importance of ongoing efforts to improve our understanding of these enigmatic events.},

JWST is now exploring higher redshifts (z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 8) and lower mass ({$\lessequivlnt$} 107 M{$\odot$}) ranges. The discovery of progressively farther quasars is instrumental to constraining the properties of the first population of black holes (BHs), or BH seeds, formed at z {$\sim$} 20-30. For the first time, we use Bayesian analysis of the most comprehensive catalog of quasars at z {$>$} 6 to constrain the distribution of BH seeds. We demonstrate that the mass distribution of BH seeds can be effectively described by combining a power law and a lognormal function tailored to the mass ranges associated with light and heavy seeds. The inferred values of the Eddington ratio, the duty cycle, and the mean radiative efficiency are 0.82+-00..1100, 0.66-+00..2233, and 0.06+-00..0022, respectively. In summary, the population of BHs that formed the detected quasars accreted, on average, at {$\sim$} 80\% Eddington for {$\sim$} 2/3 of the available time. Our analysis reveals a power-law slope of -0.70+-00..4466 and a lognormal mean of 4.44+-00..3300. Models that solely incorporate a power law or a lognormal distribution within the specific mass range corresponding to light and heavy seeds are statistically strongly disfavored. Our results suggest that including both components is necessary to comprehensively account for the masses of high-redshift quasars. Hence, we argue that both light and heavy seeds formed in the early Universe and grew to form the population of quasars we observe.},

  abstract = {One of the most exciting and pressing issues in cosmology today is the discrepancy between some measurements of the local Hubble constant and other values of the expansion rate inferred from the observed temperature and polarization fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Resolving these differences holds the potential for the discovery of new physics beyond the standard model of cosmology: Lambda Cold Dark Matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM), a successful model that has been in place for more than 20 years. Given both the fundamental significance of this outstanding discrepancy, and the many-decades-long effort to increase the accuracy of the extragalactic distance scale, it is critical to demonstrate that the local measurements are convincingly free from residual systematic errors. We review the progress over the past quarter century in measurements of the local value of the Hubble constant, and discuss remaining challenges. Particularly exciting are new data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), for which we present an overview of our program and first results. We focus in particular on Cepheids and the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) stars, as well as a relatively new method, the JAGB (J-Region Asymptotic Giant Branch) method, all currently the methods having the demonstrably smallest statistical and systematic uncertainties. JWST is delivering high-resolution near-infrared imaging data to both test for and to address directly several of the systematic uncertainties that have historically limited the accuracy of extragalactic distance scale measurements (e.g., the dimming effects of interstellar dust, chemical composition differences in the atmospheres of stars, and the crowding and blending of Cepheids contaminated by nearby previously unresolved stars). For the first galaxy in our program, NGC 7250, the high-resolution JWST images demonstrate that many of the Cepheids observed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) are significantly crowded by nearby neighbors. Avoiding the more significantly crowded variables, the scatter in the JWST near-infrared (NIR) Cepheid PL relation is decreased by a factor of two compared to those from HST, illustrating the power of JWST for improvements to local measurements of H0. Ultimately, these data will either confirm the standard model, or provide robust evidence for the inclusion of additional new physics.},

  abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II) has embarked on a multi-year project to identify and measure light curves for intermediate-redshift (0.05 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.35) Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) using repeated five-band (ugriz) imaging over an area of 300 sq. deg. The survey region is a stripe 2.5{$\smwhtcircle$} wide centered on the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap that has been imaged numerous times in earlier years, enabling construction of a deep reference image for the discovery of new objects. Supernova imaging observations are being acquired between September 1 and November 30 of 2005\textendash 7. During the first two seasons, each region was imaged on average every five nights. Spectroscopic follow-up observations to determine supernova type and redshift are carried out on a large number of telescopes. In its first two three-month seasons, the survey has discovered and measured light curves for 327 spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia, 30 probable SNe Ia, 14 confirmed SNe Ib/c, 32 confirmed SNe II, plus a large number of photometrically identified SNe Ia, 94 of which have host-galaxy spectra taken so far. This paper provides an overview of the project and briefly describes the observations completed during the first two seasons of operation.},

  abstract = {This chapter describes the current classification scheme of supernovae (SNe). This scheme has evolved over many decades and now includes numerous SN Types and sub-types. Many of these are universally recognized, while there are controversies regarding the definitions, membership and even the names of some sub-classes; we will try to review here the commonly-used nomenclature, noting the main variants when possible. SN Types are defined according to observational properties; mostly visible-light spectra near maximum light1, as well as according to their photometric properties. However, a long-term goal of SN classification is to associate observationally-defined classes with specific physical explosive phenomena. We show here that this aspiration is now finally coming to fruition, and we establish the SN classification scheme upon direct observational evidence connecting SN groups with specific progenitor stars. Observationally, the broad class of Type II SNe (\textsection{} 4) contains objects showing strong spectroscopic signatures of hydrogen, while objects lacking such signatures are of Type I, which is further divided to numerous subclasses (\textsection{} 2, \textsection{} 3). Recently a class of super-luminous SNe (SLSNe, typically 10 times more luminous than standard events) has been identified, and it is dicussed in \textsection{} 5. We end this chapter by briefly describing in \textsection{} 6 a proposed alternative classification scheme that is inspired by the stellar classification system. This system presents our emerging physical understanding of SN explosions, while clearly separating robust observational properties from physical inferences that can be debated. This new system is quantitative, and naturally deals with events distributed along a continuum, rather than being strictly divided into discrete classes.Thus, it may be more suitable to the coming era where SN numbers will quickly expand from a few thousands to millions of events.},

  abstract = {An accurate calibration of the source redshift distribution \$p(z)\$ is a key aspect in the analysis of cosmic shear data. This, one way or another, requires the use of spectroscopic or high-quality photometric samples. However, the difficulty to obtain colour-complete spectroscopic samples matching the depth of weak lensing catalogs means that the analyses of different cosmic shear datasets often use the same samples for redshift calibration. This introduces a source of statistical and systematic uncertainty that is highly correlated across different weak lensing datasets, and which must be accurately characterised and propagated in order to obtain robust cosmological constraints from their combination. In this paper we introduce a method to quantify and propagate the uncertainties on the source redshift distribution in two different surveys sharing the same calibrating sample. The method is based on an approximate analytical marginalisation of the \$p(z)\$ statistical uncertainties and the correlated marginalisation of residual systematics. We apply this method to the combined analysis of cosmic shear data from the DESY1 data release and the HSC-DR1 data, using the COSMOS 30-band catalog as a common redshift calibration sample. We find that, although there is significant correlation in the uncertainties on the redshift distributions of both samples, this does not change the final constraints on cosmological parameters significantly. The same is true also for the impact of residual systematic uncertainties from the errors in the COSMOS 30-band photometric redshifts. Additionally, we show that these effects will still be negligible in Stage-IV datasets. Finally, the combination of DESY1 and HSC-DR1 allows us to constrain the ``clumpiness'' parameter to \$S\_8 = 0.768\^\{+0.021\}\_\{-0.017\}\$. This corresponds to a \$\textbackslash sim\textbackslash sqrt\{2\}\$ improvement in uncertainties with respect to either DES or HSC alone.},

  abstract = {The distribution of ionised hydrogen during the epoch of reionization (EoR) has a complex morphology. We propose to measure the three-dimensional topology of ionised regions using the Betti numbers. These quantify the topology using the number of components, tunnels and cavities in any given field. Based on the results for a set of reionization simulations we find that the Betti numbers of the ionisation field show a characteristic evolution during reionization, with peaks in the different Betti numbers characterising different stages of the process. The shapes of their evolutionary curves can be fitted with simple analytical functions. We also observe that the evolution of the Betti numbers shows a clear connection with the percolation of the ionized and neutral regions and differs between different reionization scenarios. Through these properties, the Betti numbers provide a more useful description of the topology than the widely studied Euler characteristic or genus. The morphology of the ionisation field will be imprinted on the redshifted 21-cm signal from the EoR. We construct mock image cubes using the properties of the low-frequency element of the future Square Kilometre Array and show that we can extract the Betti numbers from such data sets if an observation time of 1000 h is used. Even for a much shorter observation time of 100 h, some topological information can be extracted for the middle and later stages of reionization. We also find that the topological information extracted from the mock 21-cm observations can put constraints on reionization models.},

This aspect makes our estimator an ideal tool for evaluating the impact of changes to LSST survey parameters that affect the measurement errors of the photometry, which is the main motivation of our work (i.e., it is not intended to provide the ``best'' photometric redshifts for LSST data). We show how the photometric redshifts will improve with time over the 10-year LSST survey and confirm that the nominal distribution of visits per filter provides the most accurate photo-z results. The LSST survey strategy naturally produces observations over a range of airmass, which offers the opportunity of using an SED- and z-dependent atmospheric affect on the observed photometry as a color-independent redshift indicator. We show that measuring this airmass effect and including it as a prior has the potential to improve the photometric redshifts and can ameliorate extreme outliers, but that it will only be adequately measured for the brightest galaxies, which limits its overall impact on LSST photometric redshifts. We furthermore demonstrate how this airmass effect can induce a bias in the photo-z results, and caution against survey strategies that prioritize high-airmass observations for the purpose of improving this prior. Ultimately, we intend for this work to serve as a guide for the expectations and preparations of the LSST science community with regards to the minimum quality of photo-z as the survey progresses.},

We reproduce the measured positions of a set of 30 multiple images with a remarkable median offset of only 0.3 by means of a comprehensive strong lensing model comprised of two cluster dark-matter halos, represented by cored elliptical pseudo-isothermal mass distributions, and the cluster member components, parameterized with dual pseudo-isothermal total mass profiles. The latter have total mass-to-light ratios increasing with the galaxy HST/WFC3 near-IR (F160W) luminosities. The measurement of the total enclosed mass within the Einstein radius is accurate to {$\sim$}5\%, including the systematic uncertainties estimated from six distinct mass models. We emphasize that the use of multiple-image systems with spectroscopic redshifts and knowledge of cluster membership based on extensive spectroscopic information is key to constructing robust high-resolution mass maps. We also produce magnification maps over the central area that is covered with HST observations. We investigate the galaxy contribution, both in terms of total and stellar mass, to the total mass budget of the cluster. When compared with the outcomes of cosmological N-body simulations, our results point to a lack of massive subhalos in the inner regions of simulated clusters with total masses similar to that of MACS J0416.1-2403. Our findings of the location and shape of the cluster dark-matter halo density profiles and on the cluster substructures provide intriguing tests of the assumed collisionless, cold nature of dark matter and of the role played by baryons in the process of structure formation.},

As early as the 1970's, Sandage et de Vaucouleurs have been arguing about the adequate methodology for such a measurement. Should astronomers focus only on their best indicators, e.g., the Cepheids, and improve the precision of this measurement based on a unique object to the best possible? Or should they ``spread the risks'', i.e., multiply the indicators and methodologies before averaging over their results? Is a robust agreement across several uncertain measures, as is currently argued to defend the existence of a `Hubble crisis' more telling than a single 1 \% precision measurement? This controversy, I argue, stems from a misconception of what managing the uncertainties associated with such experimental measurements require. Astrophysical measurements, such as the measure of the Hubble constant, require a methodology that permits both to reduce the known uncertainties and to track the unknown unknowns. Based on the lessons drawn from the so-called Hubble crisis, I sketch a methodological guide for identifying, quantifying and reducing uncertainties in astrophysical measurements, hoping that such a guide can not only help to re-frame the current Hubble tension, but serve as a starting point for future fruitful discussions between astrophysicists, astronomers and philosophers.},

We argue that the Kullback-Leibler divergence, also called the relative entropy, mathematically quantifies the Occam penalty. We further show how the Bayesian evidence stays invariant upon changing the lower prior bound of an upper constrained parameter. While a uniform prior on the tensor-to-scalar ratio disfavours the \$r\$-extension compared to the base LCDM model with odds of about 1:20, switching to a logarithmic prior renders both models essentially equally likely. LCDM with a single massive neutrino is favoured over an extension with variable neutrino masses with odds of 20:1 in case of a uniform prior on the lightest neutrino mass, which decreases to roughly 2:1 for a logarithmic prior. For both prior options we get only a very slight preference for the normal over the inverted neutrino hierarchy with Bayesian odds of about 3:2 at most.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the fact that calibrated light curves of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have become a major tool to determine the expansion history of the Universe, considerable attention has been given to, both, observations and models of these events over the past 15 years. Here, we summarize new observational constraints, address recent progress in modeling Type Ia supernovae by means of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, and discuss several of the still open questions. It will be be shown that the new models have considerable predictive power which allows us to study observable properties such as light curves and spectra without adjustable non-physical parameters. This is a necessary requisite to improve our understanding of the explosion mechanism and to settle the question of the applicability of SNe Ia as distance indicators for cosmology. We explore the capabilities of the models by comparing them with observations and we show how such models can be applied to study the origin of the diversity of SNe Ia.},

However, when the geometry of the posterior is unfavorable, it may take many expensive evaluations of the target distribution and its gradient to converge and mix. We propose neural transport (NeuTra) HMC, a technique for learning to correct this sort of unfavorable geometry using inverse autoregressive flows (IAF), a powerful neural variational inference technique. The IAF is trained to minimize the KL divergence from an isotropic Gaussian to the warped posterior, and then HMC sampling is performed in the warped space. We evaluate NeuTra HMC on a variety of synthetic and real problems, and find that it significantly outperforms vanilla HMC both in time to reach the stationary distribution and asymptotic effective-sample-size rates.},

Contrastive Learning is a self-supervised machine learning algorithm that extracts informative measurements from multidimensional data sets, which has become increasingly popular in the computer vision and Machine Learning communities in recent years. To do so, it maximizes the agreement between the information extracted from augmented versions of the same input data, making the final representation invariant to the applied transformations. Contrastive Learning is particularly useful in astronomy for removing known instrumental effects and for performing supervised classifications and regressions with a limited amount of available labels, showing a promising avenue towards Foundation Models. This short review paper briefly summarizes the main concepts behind contrastive learning and reviews the first promising applications to astronomy. We include some practical recommendations on which applications are particularly attractive for contrastive learning.},

  abstract = {Cosmography is used in cosmological data processing in order to constrain the kinematics of the universe in a model-independent way. In this paper, we first investigate the effect of the ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray relation of a quasar on cosmological constraints. By fitting the quasar relation and cosmographic parameters simultaneously, we find that the 4{$\sigma$} deviation from the cosmological constant cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) model disappears. Next, utilizing the Pantheon sample and 31 long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), we make a comparison among the different cosmographic expansions (z-redshift, y-redshift, E(y), log(1 + z), log(1 + z) + ki j, and Pade\textasciiacute{} approximations) with the third-order and fourth-order expansions. The expansion order can significantly affect the results, especially for the y-redshift method. Through analysis from the same sample, the lower-order expansion is preferable, except the y-redshift and E(y) methods. For the y-redshift and E(y) methods, despite adopting the same parameterization of y = z/(1 + z), the performance of the latter is better than that of the former. Logarithmic polynomials, log(1 + z) and log(1 + z) + ki j, perform significantly better than z-redshift, y-redshift, and E(y) methods, but worse than Pade\textasciiacute{} approximations. Finally, we comprehensively analyze the results obtained from different samples. We find that the Pade\textasciiacute (2,1) method is suitable for both low and high redshift cases. The Pade\textasciiacute (2,2) method performs well in a high-redshift situation. For the y-redshift and E(y) methods, the only constraint on the first two parameters (q0 and j0) is reliable.},

Bayesian model comparison, i.e. the computation of Bayes factors or evidence ratios, can be cast as an optimization problem. Though the Bayesian interpretation of optimal classification is well-known, here we change perspective and present classes of loss functions that result in fast, amortized neural estimators that directly estimate convenient functions of the Bayes factor. This mitigates numerical inaccuracies associated with estimating individual model probabilities. We introduce the leaky parity-odd power (l-POP) transform, leading to the novel ``l-POP-Exponential'' loss function. We explore neural density estimation for data probability in different models, showing it to be less accurate and scalable than Evidence Networks. Multiple real-world and synthetic examples illustrate that Evidence Networks are explicitly independent of dimensionality of the parameter space and scale mildly with the complexity of the posterior probability density function. This simple yet powerful approach has broad implications for model inference tasks. As an application of Evidence Networks to real-world data we compute the Bayes factor for two models with gravitational lensing data of the Dark Energy Survey. We briefly discuss applications of our methods to other, related problems of model comparison and evaluation in implicit inference settings.},

Here we review the observational properties of thermonuclear supernovae, exploding white dwarf stars resulting from the stellar evolution of low-mass stars in close binary systems. The best known objects in this class are type Ia supernovae (SN Ia), astrophysically important in their application as standardisable candles to measure cosmological distances and the primary source of iron group elements in the Universe. Surprisingly, given their prominent role, SN Ia progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms are not fully understood; the observations we describe here provide constraints on models, not always in consistent ways. Recent advances in supernova discovery and follow-up have shown that the class of thermonuclear supernovae includes more than just SN Ia, and we characterise that diversity in this review.},

We establish independent estimates of the evolution of Hubble constant by diagonalizing the covariance matrix. From type Ia supernovae and the observed Hubble parameter data, a decreasing trend of Hubble constant with a significance of 5.1\$\textbackslash sigma\$ confidence level is found. At low redshift, its value is dramatically consistent with that measured from the local distance ladder, and it drops to the value measured from the cosmic microwave background at high redshift.

Our model leverages the representational power of VAE to extract robust features from high-dimensional inputs for supervised learning tasks. The training objective unifies the generative model and the discriminative model, thus making the learning a one-stage procedure. Our experiments on real field robot data demonstrate superior failure identification performance than baseline methods, and that our model learns interpretable representations.

  abstract = {Summary statistics of likelihood, such as Bayesian evidence, offer a principled way of comparing models and assessing tension between, or within, the results of physical experiments. Noisy realisations of the data induce scatter in these model comparison statistics. For a realistic case of cosmological inference from large-scale structure, we show that the logarithm of the Bayes factor attains scatter of order unity, increasing significantly with stronger tension between the models under comparison. We develop an approximate procedure that quantifies the sampling distribution of the evidence at a small additional computational cost and apply it to real data to demonstrate the impact of the scatter, which acts to reduce the significance of any model discrepancies. Data compression is highlighted as a potential avenue to suppressing noise in the evidence to negligible levels, with a proof of concept demonstrated using Planck cosmic microwave background data.},

  abstract = {Measurements of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, w, have been limited by uncertainty in the selection effects and photometric calibration of z{$<$}0.1 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The Foundation Supernova Survey is designed to lower these uncertainties by creating a new sample of z{$<$}0.1 SNe Ia observed on the Pan-STARRS system. Here we combine the Foundation sample with SNe from the Pan-STARRS Medium Deep Survey and measure cosmological parameters with 1338 SNe from a single telescope and a single, well-calibrated photometric system. For the first time, both the low-z and high-z data are predominantly discovered by surveys that do not target preselected galaxies, reducing selection bias uncertainties. The z{$>$}0.1 data include 875 SNe without spectroscopic classifications, and we show that we can robustly marginalize over CC SN contamination. We measure Foundation Hubble residuals to be fainter than the preexisting low-z Hubble residuals by 0.046{$\pm$}0.027mag (stat + sys). By combining the SN Ia data with cosmic microwave background constraints, we find w=-0.938{$\pm$}0.053, consistent with {$\Lambda$}CDM. With 463 spectroscopically classified SNe Ia alone, we measure w=-0.933{$\pm$}0.061. Using the more homogeneous and better-characterized Foundation sample gives a 55\% reduction in the systematic uncertainty attributed to SN Ia sample selection biases. Although use of just a single photometric system at low and high redshift increases the impact of photometric calibration uncertainties in this analysis, previous low-z samples may have correlated calibration uncertainties that were neglected in past studies. The full Foundation sample will observe up to 800 SNe to anchor the LSST and WFIRST Hubble diagrams.},

  abstract = {Recent studies found a correlation with {$\sim$}3{$\sigma$} significance between the local star formation measured by GALEX in SN Ia host galaxies and the distances or dispersions derived from these SNe. We search for these effects by using data from recent cosmological analyses to greatly increase the SN Ia sample; we include 179 GALEX-imaged SN Ia hosts with distances from the Joint Light-curve Analysis (JLA) and Pan-STARRS SN Ia cosmology samples and 157 GALEX-imaged SN Ia hosts with distances from the Riess et al. H0 measurement. We find little evidence that SNe Ia in locally star-forming environments are fainter after light curve correction than SNe Ia in locally passive environments. We find a difference of 0.000 {$\pm$} 0.018 (stat+sys) mag for SNe fit with SALT2 and 0.029 {$\pm$} 0.027 (stat+sys) mag for SNe fit with MLCS2k2 (RV = 2.5), which suggests that proposed changes to recent measurements of H0 and w are not significant and numerically smaller than the parameter measurement uncertainties. We measure systematic uncertainties of {$\sim$}0.01\textendash 0.02 mag by performing several plausible variants of our analysis. We find the greatly reduced significance of these distance modulus differences compared to Rigault et al. results from two improvements with fairly equal effects, our larger sample size and the use of the JLA and Riess et al. sample selection criteria. Without these improvements, we recover the results of Rigault et al. We find that both populations havesimilar dispersions in distance than found by Rigault et al. and Kelly et al., with slightly smaller dispersions for locally passive (log(SSFR) {$<$} -2.9 dex) SNe Ia fit with MLCS, the opposite of the effect seen by Rigault et al. and Kelly et al. We caution that measuring the local environments of SNe Ia in the future may require a higherresolution instrument than GALEX and that SN Ia sample selection has a significant effect on local star formation biases.},

To robustly answer this question, we use a very flexible parameterization for the dark energy equation of state such that every cosmological distance still allowed by data exists within this prior volume. To then answer whether there exists a satisfactory solution to the \$H\_0\$ tension within this comprehensive parameterization, we constrained the parametric form using different partitions of the Planck cosmic microwave background, SDSS-IV/eBOSS DR16 baryon acoustic oscillation, and Pantheon supernova datasets. When constrained by just the cosmic microwave background dataset, there exists a set of equations of state which yields high \$H\_0\$ values, but these equations of state are ruled out by the combination of the supernova and baryon acoustic oscillation datasets. In other words, the constraint from the cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillation, and supernova datasets together does not allow for high \$H\_0\$ values and converges around an equation of state consistent with a cosmological constant. Thus, since this very flexible parameterization does not offer a solution to the \$H\_0\$ tension, there can be no solution to the \$H\_0\$ tension that adds physics at only low redshifts. This is directly related to the expansion history of the Universe and its geometrical properties and would include models beyond those parametrized by \$w(z)\$.},

  abstract = {Recent analyses have found intriguing correlations between the colour ({$\mathsl{c}$}) of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and the size of their mass-step, the relationship between host galaxy stellar mass and Hubble residual. These analyses suggest that the underlying cause of this relationship is dust. Using a sample of 675 photometrically-classified SNe Ia from the Dark Energy Survey 5-year sample, we study the differences in Hubble residual for a variety of host and local properties for subsamples split by their colour ({$\mathsl{c}$}). We find a 3{$\mathsl{\sigma}$} difference for the size of the mass-step when comparing blue ({$\mathsl{c}$} {$<$} 0) and red ({$\mathsl{c}$} {$>$} 0) SNe. We observe the lowest r.m.s. scatter ({$\sim$} 0.14) in Hubble residual for blue SNe in low mass or blue environments, suggesting that these objects provide the most homogeneous sample for cosmological analyses. By fitting for {$\mathsl{c}$}-dependent relationships between Hubble residuals and {$\mathsl{M}$}stellar, approximating existing dust models, we remove the mass-step from the data but find significant remaining steps in rest-frame {$\mathsl{U}$} - {$\mathsl{R}$}, indicating that current dust modelling based on {$\mathsl{M}$}stellar may not fully explain the remaining dispersion in SN luminosity. The most dispersion is removed by instead accounting for a {$\mathsl{c}$}-dependent relationship between Hubble residuals and global {$\mathsl{U}$} - {$\mathsl{R}$}, resulting in {$\leq$} 1{$\mathsl{\sigma}$} remaining steps in other environmental properties, suggesting that {$\mathsl{U}$} - {$\mathsl{R}$} provides different information about the environment of SNe Ia to {$\mathsl{M}$}stellar. This {$\mathsl{c}$}-dependent {$\mathsl{U}$} - {$\mathsl{R}$} relation implies that {$\mathsl{U}$} - {$\mathsl{R}$} may be more closely linked to dust, motivating the future inclusion of galaxy {$\mathsl{U}$} - {$\mathsl{R}$} colour in the correction for SN distance biases.},

  abstract = {Analyses of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have found puzzling correlations between their standardised luminosities and host galaxy properties: SNe Ia in high-mass, passive hosts appear brighter than those in lower-mass, star-forming hosts. We examine the host galaxies of SNe Ia in the Dark Energy Survey three-year spectroscopically-confirmed cosmological sample, obtaining photometry in a series of `local' apertures centred on the SN, and for the global host galaxy. We study the differences in these host galaxy properties, such as stellar mass and rest-frame {$\mathsl{U}$} - {$\mathsl{R}$} colours, and their correlations with SN Ia parameters including Hubble residuals. We find all Hubble residual steps to be {$>$} 3{$\mathsl{\sigma}$} in significance, both for splitting at the traditional environmental property sample median and for the step of maximum significance. For stellar mass, we find a maximal local step of 0.098 {$\pm$} 0.018 mag; {$\sim$} 0.03 mag greater than the largest global stellar mass step in our sample (0.070 {$\pm$} 0.017 mag). When splitting at the sample median, differences between local and global {$\mathsl{U}$} - {$\mathsl{R}$} steps are small, both {$\sim$} 0.08 mag, but are more significant than the global stellar mass step (0.057 {$\pm$} 0.017 mag). We split the data into sub-samples based on SN Ia light curve parameters: stretch ({$\mathsl{x}$}1) and colour ({$\mathsl{c}$}), finding that redder objects ({$\mathsl{c}$} {$>$} 0) have larger Hubble residual steps, for both stellar mass and {$\mathsl{U}$} - {$\mathsl{R}$}, for both local and global measurements, of {$\sim$} 0.14 mag. Additionally, the bluer (star-forming) local environments host a more homogeneous SN Ia sample, with local {$\mathsl{U}$} - {$\mathsl{R}$} r.m.s. scatter as low as 0.084 {$\pm$} 0.017 mag for blue ({$\mathsl{c}$} {$<$} 0) SNe Ia in locally blue {$\mathsl{U}$} - {$\mathsl{R}$} environments.},

  abstract = {Bayesian Estimation Applied to Multiple Species (BEAMS) has been implemented in the BEAMS with Bias Corrections (BBC) framework to produce a redshift-binned Hubble diagram (HD) for Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia). The BBC method corrects for selection effects and non-SNIa contamination, and systematic uncertainties are described by a covariance matrix with dimension matching the number of BBC redshift bins. For spectroscopically confirmed SNIa samples, a recent ``Binning is Sinning'' article (BHS21, arxiv:2012.05900) showed that an unbinned HD and covariance matrix reduces the systematic uncertainty by a factor of {$\sim$}1.5 compared to the binned approach. Here we extend their analysis to obtain an unbinned HD for a photometrically identified sample processed with BBC. To test this new method, we simulate and analyze 50 samples corresponding to the Dark Energy Survey (DES) with a low-redshift anchor; the simulation includes SNe Ia, and contaminants from core collapse SNe and peculiar SNe Ia. The analysis includes systematic uncertainties for calibration, and measures the dark energy equation of state parameter (w). Compared to a redshift-binned HD, the unbinned HD with nearly 2,000 events results in a smaller systematic uncertainty, in qualitative agreement with BHS21, and averaging results among the 50 samples we find no evidence for bias in measured cosmological parameters. To reduce computation time for fitting an unbinned HD with large samples, we propose an HD-rebinning method that defines the HD in bins of redshift, color, and stretch; the rebinned HD results in similar uncertainty as the unbinned case, and shows no evidence for biased cosmology parameters.},

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

In short, either we embrace radical change ourselves or radical changes will be visited upon our physical world. The status quo is no longer an option. In This Changes Everything Naomi Klein argues that climate change isn't just another issue to be neatly filed between taxes and health care. It's an alarm that calls us to fix an economic system that is already failing us in many ways. Klein meticulously builds the case for how massively reducing our greenhouse emissions is our best chance to simultaneously reduce gaping inequalities, re-imagine our broken democracies, and rebuild our gutted local economies. She exposes the ideological desperation of the climate-change deniers, the messianic delusions of the would-be geoengineers, and the tragic defeatism of too many mainstream green initiatives. And she demonstrates precisely why the market has not--and cannot--fix the climate crisis but will instead make things worse, with ever more extreme and ecologically damaging extraction methods, accompanied by rampant disaster capitalism. Klein argues that the changes to our relationship with nature and one another that are required to respond to the climate crisis humanely should not be viewed as grim penance, but rather as a kind of gift--a catalyst to transform broken economic and cultural priorities and to heal long-festering historical wounds. And she documents the inspiring movements that have already begun this process: communities that are not just refusing to be sites of further fossil fuel extraction but are building the next, regeneration-based economies right now. Can we pull off these changes in time? Nothing is certain. Nothing except that climate change changes everything. And for a very brief time, the nature of that change is still up to us"--},

We use statistics based upon the Quantile-Quantile (Q--Q) plot to identify biases and signatures of underestimated or overestimated errors in photo-z probability density functions (PDFs) produced by six groups in the collaboration; correcting for these effects makes the resulting PDFs better match the statistical definition of a PDF. After correcting each group's PDF, we explore three methods of combining the different groups' PDFs for a given object into a consensus curve. Two of these methods are based on identifying the minimum f-divergence curve, i.e., the PDF that is closest in aggregate to the other PDFs in a set (analogous to the median of an array of numbers). We demonstrate that these techniques yield improved results using sets of spectroscopic redshifts independent of those used to optimize PDF modifications. The best photo-z PDFs and point estimates are achieved with the minimum f-divergence using the best 4 PDFs for each object (mFDa4) and the Hierarchical Bayesian (HB4) methods, respectively. The HB4 photo-z point estimates produced \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash rm NMAD\} = 0.0227/0.0189\$ and \$|\textbackslash Delta z/(1+z)| {$>$} 0.15\$ outlier fraction = 0.067/0.019 for spectroscopic and 3D-HST redshifts, respectively.

CosmoDC2 is the starting point for the second data challenge (DC2) carried out by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (LSST DESC). The catalog is based on a trillion-particle, (4.225 Gpc)3 box cosmological N-body simulation, the Outer Rim run. It covers 440deg2 of sky area to a redshift of z=3 and matches expected number densities from contemporary surveys to a magnitude depth of 28 in the r band. Each galaxy is characterized by a multitude of galaxy properties including stellar mass, morphology, spectral energy distributions, broadband filter magnitudes, host halo information, and weak lensing shear. The size and complexity of cosmoDC2 requires an efficient catalog generation methodology; our approach is based on a new hybrid technique that combines data-based empirical approaches with semianalytic galaxy modeling. A wide range of observation-based validation tests has been implemented to ensure that cosmoDC2 enables the science goals of the planned LSSTDESC DC2 analyses. This paper also represents the official release of the cosmoDC2 data set, including an efficient reader that facilitates interaction with the data.},

We apply this approach to recent measurements of cosmic microwave background anisotropies combined with the Hubble Space Telescope measurement of the Hubble parameter. Using mildly non-informative priors, we show how the 3-year WMAP data improves on the first-year data by being able to measure both the spectral index and the reionization epoch at the same time. We also find that a non-zero curvature is strongly disfavored. We conclude that although current data could constrain at least seven effective parameters, only six of them are required in a scheme based on the Lambda-CDM concordance cosmology.},

  abstract = {We present a new method for inferring photometric redshifts in deep galaxy and quasar surveys, based on a datadriven model of latent spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and a physical model of photometric fluxes as a function of redshift. This conceptually novel approach combines the advantages of both machine learning methods and template fitting methods by building template SEDs directly from the spectroscopic training data. This is made computationally tractable with Gaussian processes operating in flux\textendash redshift space, encoding the physics of redshifts and the projection of galaxy SEDs onto photometric bandpasses. This method alleviates the need to acquire representative training data or to construct detailed galaxy SED models; it requires only that the photometric bandpasses and calibrations be known or have parameterized unknowns. The training data can consist of a combination of spectroscopic and deep many-band photometric data with reliable redshifts, which do not need to entirely spatially overlap with the target survey of interest or even involve the same photometric bands. We showcase the method on the i-magnitude-selected, spectroscopically confirmed galaxies in the COSMOS field. The model is trained on the deepest bands (from SUBARU and HST) and photometric redshifts are derived using the shallower SDSS optical bands only. We demonstrate that we obtain accurate redshift point estimates and probability distributions despite the training and target sets having very different redshift distributions, noise properties, and even photometric bands. Our model can also be used to predict missing photometric fluxes or to simulate populations of galaxies with realistic fluxes and redshifts, for example.},

This is achieved by extending the Suspiciousness statistic, which is insensitive to priors. Our method uses global summary statistics, and as such it can be used as a diagnostic for internal consistency. We show how our approach can be combined with methods that use parameter space and data space to identify the existing internal discrepancies. As an example, we use it to test the internal consistency of the KiDS-450 data in four photometric redshift bins, and to recover controlled internal discrepancies in simulated KiDS data. We propose this as a diagnostic of internal consistency for present and future cosmological surveys, and as a tension metric for data sets that have non-negligible correlation, such as Large Synoptic Spectroscopic Survey and Euclid.},

Whilst observations of cosmological supernovae unambiguously display the expected redshift-dependent time dilation, this has not been the case for other distant sources. Here we present the identification of cosmic time dilation in a sample of 190 quasars monitored for over two decades in multiple wavebands by assessing various hypotheses through Bayesian analysis. This detection counters previous claims that observed quasar variability lacked the expected redshift-dependent time dilation. Hence, as well as demonstrating the claim that the lack of the redshift dependence of quasar variability represents a significant challenge to the standard cosmological model, this analysis further indicates that the properties of quasars are consistent with them being truly cosmologically distant sources.},

In principle, weak gravitational lensing will enable an approximately unbiased measurement of mass, but parametric methods for extracting cluster masses from data require the additional knowledge of halo concentration. Measurements of both mass and concentration are limited by the degeneracy between the two parameters, particularly in low-mass, high-redshift systems where the signal to noise is low. In this paper, we develop a hierarchical model of mass and concentration for mass inference, we test our method on toy data and then apply it to a sample of galaxy groups and poor clusters down to masses of {$\sim$}1013 M . Our fit and model gives a relationship among masses, concentrations and redshift that allow prediction of these parameters from incomplete and noisy future measurements. Additionally, the underlying population can be used to infer an observationally based concentration\textendash mass relation. Our method is equivalent to a quasistacking approach with the degree of stacking set by the data. We also demonstrate that mass and concentration derived from pure stacking can be offset from the population mean with differing values depending on the method of stacking.},

  abstract = {Absolute distances from strong lensing can anchor Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) at cosmological distances giving a model-independent inference of the Hubble constant (H0). Future observations could provide strong lensing time delay distances with source redshifts up to z {$\simeq$} 4, which are much higher than the maximum redshift of SNe Ia observed so far. Quasars are also observed at high redshifts and can be potentially used as standard candles based on a linear relation between the log of the ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray luminosities. In order to make full use of time delay distances measured at higher redshifts, we use quasars as a complementary cosmic probe to measure cosmological distances at redshifts beyond those of SNe Ia and provide a model-independent method to determine the Hubble constant. In this work, we demonstrate a model-independent, joint constraint of SNe Ia, quasars, and time-delay distances. We first generate mock datasets of SNe Ia, quasar, and time-delay distances based on a fiducial cosmological model. Then, we calibrate quasar parameters model independently using Gaussian process (GP) regression with mock SNe Ia data. Finally, we determine the value of H0 model-independently using GP regression from mock quasars and time-delay distances from strong lensing systems. As a comparison, we also show the H0 results obtained from mock SNe Ia in combination with time delay lensing systems whose redshifts overlap with SNe Ia. Our results show that quasars at higher redshifts show great potential to extend the redshift coverage of SNe Ia and thus enables the full use of strong lens time-delay distance measurements from ongoing cosmic surveys and improve the accuracy of the estimation of H0 from 2.1\% to 1.3\%.},

We run (dis)concordance tests within each set and across the sets using a recently introduced index of inconsistency (IOI) capable of dissecting inconsistencies between two or more data sets. First, we compare the constraints on \$H\_0\$ from five different methods and find that the IOI drops from 2.85 to 0.88 (on Jeffreys' scales) when the local \$H\_0\$ measurements is removed. This seems to indicate that the local measurement is an outlier, thus favoring a systematics-based explanation. We find a moderate inconsistency (IOI=2.61) between Planck temperature and polarization. We find that current LSS data sets including WiggleZ, SDSS RSD, CFHTLenS, CMB lensing and SZ cluster count, are consistent one with another and when all combined. However, we find a persistent moderate inconsistency between Planck and individual or combined LSS probes. For Planck TT+lowTEB versus individual LSS probes, the IOI spans the range 2.92--3.72 and increases to 3.44--4.20 when the polarization data is added in. The joint LSS versus the combined Planck temperature and polarization has an IOI of 2.83 in the most conservative case. But if Planck lowTEB is added to the joint LSS to constrain \$\textbackslash tau\$ and break degeneracies, the inconsistency between Planck and joint LSS data increases to the high-end of the moderate range with IOI=4.81. Whether due to systematic effects in the data or to the underlying model, these inconsistencies need to be resolved. Finally, we perform forecast calculations using LSST and find that the discordance between Planck and future LSS data, if it persists as present, can rise up to a high IOI of 17, thus falling in the strong range of inconsistency.

  abstract = {This is the third paper of a series in which we present new measurements of the observed rates of supernovae (SNe) in the local Universe, determined from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS). We have considered a sample of {$\sim$}1000 SNe and used an optimal subsample of 726 SNe (274 SNe Ia, 116 SNe Ibc and 324 SNe II) to determine our rates. We study the trend of the rates as a function of a few quantities available for our galaxy sample, such as luminosity in the B and K bands, stellar mass and morphological class. We discuss different choices (SN samples, input SN luminosity functions, inclination correction factors) and their effect on the rates and their uncertainties. A comparison between our SN rates and the published measurements shows that they are consistent with each other to within the uncertainties when the rate calculations are done in the same manner. Nevertheless, our data demonstrate that the rates cannot be adequately described by a single parameter using either galaxy Hubble types or B - K colours. A secondary parameter in galaxy `size', expressed by luminosity or stellar mass, is needed to adequately describe the rates in the rate\textendash size relation: the galaxies of smaller sizes have higher SN rates per unit mass or per unit luminosity. The trends of the SN rates in galaxies of different Hubble types and colours are discussed. We examine possible causes for the rate\textendash size relation. Physically, such a relation for the core-collapse SNe is probably linked to the correlation between the specific star-formation rate and the galaxy sizes, but it is not clear whether the same link can be established for SNe Ia. We discuss the two-component (`tardy' and `prompt') model for SN Ia rates, and find that the SN Ia rates in young stellar populations might have a strong correlation with the core-collapse SN rates. We derive volumetric rates for the different SN types [e.g. for SNe Ia, a rate of (0.301 {$\pm$} 0.062) \texttimes{} 10-4 SN Mpc-3 yr-1 at redshift 0] and compare them to the measurements at different redshifts. Finally, we estimate the SN rate for the Milky Way Galaxy to be 2.84 {$\pm$} 0.60 SNe per century (with a systematic uncertainty of a factor of {$\sim$}2), consistent with published SN rates based on several different techniques.},

We examined late-time optical spectra of 36 SNe Ia, including five from our own project (SNe 2019np, 2019ein, 2021hpr, 2021wuf, and 2022hrs), with phase coverage of {$\sim$} 200 to {$\sim$} 400 days after maximum light. At this late phase, the outer ejecta have become transparent and the features of inner iron-group elements emerge in the spectra. Based on multicomponent Gaussian fits and reasonable choices for the pseudocontinuum around Ni and Fe emission features, we get reliable estimates of the Ni to Fe ratio, which is sensitive to the explosion models of SNe Ia. Our results show that the majority (about 67\%) of our SNe Ia are more consistent with the sub-Chandrasekhar-mass (i.e., double-detonation) model, although they could be affected by evolutionary or ionisation effects. Moreover, we find that the Si II {$\mathsl{\lambda}$}6355 velocity measured around the time of maximum light tends to increase with the Ni to Fe ratio for the subsample with either redshifted or blueshifted nebular velocities, suggesting that progenitor metallicity might play an important role in accounting for the observed velocity diversity of SNe Ia.},

  abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) play a key role in the fields of astrophysics and cosmology. It is widely accepted that SNe Ia arise from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs (WDs) in binary systems. However, there is no consensus on the fundamental aspects of the nature of SN Ia progenitors and their actual explosion mechanism. This fundamentally flaws our understanding of these important astrophysical objects. In this review, we outline the diversity of SNe Ia and the proposed progenitor models and explosion mechanisms. We discuss the recent theoretical and observational progress in addressing the SN Ia progenitor and explosion mechanism in terms of the observables at various stages of the explosion, including rates and delay times, pre-explosion companion stars, ejecta\textendash companion interaction, early excess emission, early radio/X-ray emission from circumstellar material (CSM) interaction, surviving companion stars, late-time spectra and photometry, polarization signals, and supernova remnant properties, etc. Despite the efforts from both the theoretical and observational side, the questions of how the WDs reach an explosive state and what progenitor systems are more likely to produce SNe Ia remain open. No single published model is able to consistently explain all observational features and the full diversity of SNe Ia. This may indicate that either a new progenitor paradigm or the improvement of current models is needed if all SNe Ia arise from the same origin. An alternative scenario is that different progenitor channels and explosion mechanisms contribute to SNe Ia. In the next decade, the ongoing campaigns with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Gaia and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), and upcoming extensive projects with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will allow us to conduct not only studies of individual SNe Ia in unprecedented detail but also systematic investigations for different subclasses of SNe Ia. This will advance theory and observations of SNe Ia sufficiently far to gain a deeper understanding of their origin and explosion mechanism.},

In this framework, models are compared through their marginal likelihoods, or their quotients, called Bayes factors. However, marginal likelihoods depends on the prior choice. For model selection, even diffuse priors can be actually very informative, unlike for the parameter estimation problem. Furthermore, when the prior is improper, the marginal likelihood of the corresponding model is undetermined. In this work, we discuss the issue of prior sensitivity of the marginal likelihood and its role in model selection. We also comment on the use of uninformative priors, which are very common choices in practice. Several practical suggestions are discussed and many possible solutions, proposed in the literature, to design objective priors for model selection are described. Some of them also allow the use of improper priors. The connection between the marginal likelihood approach and the well-known information criteria is also presented. We describe the main issues and possible solutions by illustrative numerical examples, providing also some related code. One of them involving a real-world application on exoplanet detection.},

We find that deviation is indeed equivalent in a normal distribution to eq. s deviation in the frequency of values, where eq. = 0.83 0.62. Hence, a tension of 4.4 , estimated between the local Cepheid\textendash supernova distance ladder and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, is indeed a 2.1 tension in equivalent terms of a normal distribution of frequencies, with an associated probability ({$>$} eq.) = 0.036 (1 in 28). This can be increased up to a equivalent tension of 2.5 in the worst of the cases of claimed 6 tension, which may anyway happen as a random statistical fluctuation.},

  abstract = {We describe the simulated sky survey underlying the second data challenge (DC2) carried out in preparation for analysis of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (LSST DESC). Significant connections across multiple science domains will be a hallmark of LSST; the DC2 program represents a unique modeling effort that stresses this interconnectivity in a way that has not been attempted before. This effort encompasses a full end-to-end approach: starting from a large N-body simulation, through setting up LSST-like observations including realistic cadences, through image simulations, and finally processing with Rubin's LSST Science Pipelines. This last step ensures that we generate data products resembling those to be delivered by the Rubin Observatory as closely as is currently possible. The simulated DC2 sky survey covers six optical bands in a wide-fast-deep (WFD) area of approximately 300 deg2 as well as a deep drilling field (DDF) of approximately 1 deg2. We simulate 5 years of the planned 10-year survey. The DC2 sky survey has multiple purposes. First, the LSST DESC working groups can use the dataset to develop a range of DESC analysis pipelines to prepare for the advent of actual data. Second, it serves as a realistic testbed for the image processing software under development for LSST by the Rubin Observatory. In particular, simulated data provide a controlled way to investigate certain image-level systematic effects. Finally, the DC2 sky survey enables the exploration of new scientific ideas in both static and time-domain cosmology.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, an avalanche of data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic ``dark ages'' to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z {$\approx$} 1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed after z = 0.7. Less than {$\sim$} 1\% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

  abstract = {Conventional Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) cosmology analyses currently use a simplistic linear regression of magnitude versus color and light curve shape, which does not model intrinsic SN Ia variations and host galaxy dust as physically distinct effects, resulting in low color-magnitude slopes. We construct a probabilistic generative model for the dusty distribution of extinguished absolute magnitudes and apparent colors as the convolution of a intrinsic SN Ia color-magnitude distribution and a host galaxy dust reddening-extinction distribution. If the intrinsic color-magnitude (MB vs. B - V ) slope {$\beta$}int differs from the host galaxy dust law RB, this convolution results in a specific curve of mean extinguished absolute magnitude vs. apparent color. The derivative of this curve smoothly transitions from {$\beta$}int in the blue tail to RB in the red tail of the apparent color distribution. The conventional linear fit approximates this effective curve near the average apparent color, resulting in an apparent slope {$\beta$}app between {$\beta$}int and RB. We incorporate these effects into a hierarchical Bayesian statistical model for SN Ia light curve measurements, and analyze a dataset of SALT2 optical light curve fits of 248 nearby SN Ia at z {$<$} 0.10. The conventional linear fit obtains {$\beta$}app {$\approx$} 3. Our model finds a {$\beta$}int = 2.3 {$\pm$} 0.3 and a distinct dust law of RB = 3.8 {$\pm$} 0.3, consistent with the average for Milky Way dust, while correcting a systematic distance bias of {$\sim$} 0.10 mag in the tails of the apparent color distribution. Finally, we extend our model to examine the SN Ia luminosity-host mass dependence in terms of intrinsic and dust components.},

In particular we find, with a high statistical significance, that the type Ia rate in late type galaxies is a factor {$\sim$}20 higher than in E/S0. Similarly, the type Ia rate in the galaxies bluer than B - K = 2.6 is about a factor of 30 larger than in galaxies with B - K {$>$} 4.1. These findings can be explained by assuming that a significant fraction of Ia events in late spirals/irregulars originates in a relatively young stellar component.},

We review the basics of SN rate measurement, preach about some sins of SN rate measurement and analysis, and illustrate one of these sins with an analogy about Martian scientists. We review the recent progress in measuring SN Ia rates in various environments and redshifts, and their use to reconstruct the SN Ia delay-time distribution (DTD) \textemdash{} the SN rate versus time that would follow a hypothetical brief burst of star formation. A good number of DTD measurements, using a variety of methods, appear to be converging. At delays 1 , t , 10 Gyr, these measurements show a similar, ,t\`A1, power-law shape. The DTD peaks at the shortest delays probed. This result supports the idea of a double-degenerate progenitor origin for SNe Ia. Single-degenerate progenitors may still play a role in producing short-delay SNe Ia, or perhaps all SNe Ia, if the red-giant donor channel is more efficient than is found by most theoretical models. The DTD normalization enjoys fairly good agreement (though perhaps some tension), among the various measurements, with a Hubble time\textendash integrated DTD value of about 2 \AE{} 1 SNe Ia per 1000 M\vphantom\{\} (stellar mass formed with a low\textendash mass turnover initial mass function). The local WD binary population suggests that the WD merger rate can explain the Galactic SN Ia rate, but only if subChandra mergers lead to SN Ia events. We point to some future directions that should lead to progress in the field, including measurement of the bivariate (delay and stretch) SN Ia response function.},

There are a number of key advantages to these methods, centred around the ability to perform scalable statistical inference without an explicit likelihood. In this work, we propose two technical building blocks to a specific sequential SBI algorithm, truncated marginal neural ratio estimation (TMNRE). In particular, first we develop autoregressive ratio estimation with the aim to robustly estimate correlated high-dimensional posteriors. Secondly, we propose a slice-based nested sampling algorithm to efficiently draw both posterior samples and constrained prior samples from ratio estimators, the latter being instrumental for sequential inference. To validate our implementation, we carry out inference tasks on three concrete examples: a toy model of a multi-dimensional Gaussian, the analysis of a stellar stream mock observation, and finally, a proof-of-concept application to substructure searches in strong gravitational lensing. In addition, we publicly release the code for both the autoregressive ratio estimator and the slice sampler.},

Several cosmological probes (Cosmic Microwave Background, Supernovae Type Ia, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations) have been studied in depth to better understand the nature of the mechanism driving this acceleration, and they are being currently pushed to their limits, obtaining remarkable constraints that allowed us to shape the standard cosmological model. In parallel to that, however, the percent precision achieved has recently revealed apparent tensions between measurements obtained from different methods. These are either indicating some unaccounted systematic effects, or are pointing toward new physics. Following the development of CMB, SNe, and BAO cosmology, it is critical to extend our selection of cosmological probes. Novel probes can be exploited to validate results, control or mitigate systematic effects, and, most importantly, to increase the accuracy and robustness of our results.},

  abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have assumed a fundamental role as cosmological distance indicators since the discovery of the accelerating expansion rate of the universe (Perlmutter et al., 1999; Riess et al., 1998). Correlations between their optical peak luminosity, the decline rate of their light curves and their optical colours allow them to be standardised, reducing their observed r.m.s scatter (e.g. Phillips, 1993; Tripp, 1998). Over a decade ago, the optical peak luminosity of SNe Ia was found to correlate with host galaxy stellar mass, further improving their standardisation (Kelly \& others, 2010; Lampeitl et al., 2010; Sullivan et al., 2010). Since then, host galaxy properties have been used in cosmological analyses of SNe Ia (Betoule et al., 2014; Brout et al., 2019; Scolnic et al., 2018) and tremendous effort has gone into findig the property, such as star formation rate (Rigault et al., 2013), that fundamentally drives the correlation between SNe Ia and their host galaxies. Furthermore, it has been noted that the local environment in which the progenitors of SNe Ia evolve is much better at reducing the scatter in estimated distances than the global environment, i.e., the whole galaxy (Roman et al., 2018; Kelsey et al., 2021). Therefore, the study of the effect of environment on SNe Ia is an active field of research and key in future cosmological analyses.},

  abstract = {Recent studies suggest spectroscopic differences explain a fraction of the variation in Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) luminosities after light-curve/color standardization. In this work, (i) we empirically characterize the variations of standardized SN Ia luminosities, and (ii) we use a spectroscopically inferred parameter, SIP, to improve the precision of SNe Ia along the distance ladder and the determination of the Hubble constant (H0). First, we show that the Pantheon+ covariance model modestly overestimates the uncertainty of standardized magnitudes by {$\sim$} 7\%, in the parameter space used by the SH0ES Team to measure H0; accounting for this alone yields H0 = 73.01 {$\pm$} 0.92 km s-1 Mpc-1. Furthermore, accounting for spectroscopic similarity between SNe Ia on the distance ladder reduces their relative scatter to {$\sim$} 0.12 mag per object (compared to {$\sim$} 0.14 mag previously). Combining these two findings in the model of SN covariance, we find an overall 14\% reduction (to {$\pm$}0.85 km s-1 Mpc-1) of the uncertainty in the Hubble constant and a modest increase in its value. Including a budget for systematic uncertainties itemized by Riess et al. (2022a), we report an updated local Hubble constant with {$\sim$} 1.2\% uncertainty, H0 = 73.29{$\pm$}0.90 km s-1 Mpc-1. We conclude that spectroscopic differences among photometrically standardized SNe Ia do not explain the ``Hubble tension.'' Rather, accounting for such differences increases its significance, as the discrepancy against {$\Lambda$}CDM calibrated by the Planck 2018 measurement rises to 5.7{$\sigma$}.},

The most conservative and widely used approach is Bayesian model comparison. In this paper we explicitly calculate the Bayes factors for all models that are linear with respect to their parameters. We do this in order to test the so called Jeffreys' scale and determine analytically how accurate its predictions are in a simple case where we fully understand and can calculate everything analytically. We also discuss the case of nested models, e.g. one with \$M\_1\$ and another with \$M\_2\textbackslash supset M\_1\$ parameters and we derive analytic expressions for both the Bayes factor and the Figure of Merit, defined as the inverse area of the model parameter's confidence contours. With all this machinery and the use of an explicit example we demonstrate that the threshold nature of Jeffreys' scale is not a "one size fits all" reliable tool for model comparison and that it may lead to biased conclusions. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of choosing the right basis in the context of models that are linear with respect to their parameters and how that basis affects the parameter estimation and the derived constraints.},

  abstract = {The detailed nature of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) remains uncertain, and as survey statistics increase, the question of astrophysical systematic uncertainties arises, notably that of the evolution of SN Ia populations. We study the dependence on redshift of the SN Ia SALT2.4 light-curve stretch, which is a purely intrinsic SN property, to probe its potential redshift drift. The SN stretch has been shown to be strongly correlated with the SN environment, notably with stellar age tracers. We modeled the underlying stretch distribution as a function of redshift, using the evolution of the fraction of young and old SNe Ia as predicted using the SNfactory dataset, and assuming a constant underlying stretch distribution for each age population consisting of Gaussian mixtures. We tested our prediction against published samples that were cut to have marginal magnitude selection effects, so that any observed change is indeed astrophysical and not observational in origin. In this first study, there are indications that the underlying SN Ia stretch distribution evolves as a function of redshift, and that the age drifting model is a better description of the data than any time-constant model, including the sample-based asymmetric distributions that are often used to correct Malmquist bias at a significance higher than 5{$\sigma$}. The favored underlying stretch model is a bimodal one, composed of a high-stretch mode shared by both young and old environments, and a low-stretch mode that is exclusive to old environments. The precise effect of the redshift evolution of the intrinsic properties of a SN Ia population on cosmology remains to be studied. The astrophysical drift of the SN stretch distribution does affect current Malmquist bias corrections, however, and thereby the distances that are derived based on SN that are affected by observational selection effects. We highlight that this bias will increase with surveys covering increasingly larger redshift ranges, which is particularly important for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.},

There is consensus that a white dwarf star explodes after accreting matter in a binary system, but the secondary could be anything from a main sequence star to a red giant, or even another white dwarf. The uncertainty stems from the fact that no recent SN Ia has been discovered close enough to detect the stars before explosion. Here we report early observations of SN 2011fe (PTF11kly) in M101 at a distance of 6.4 Mpc, the closest SN Ia in the past 25 years. We find that the exploding star was likely a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, and from the lack of an early shock we conclude that the companion was most likely a main sequence star. Early spectroscopy shows high-velocity oxygen that varies on a time scale of hours and extensive mixing of newly synthesized intermediate mass elements in the outermost layers of the supernova. A companion paper uses pre-explosion images to rule out luminous red giants and most helium stars as companions.},

However, the natures of the progenitor system(s) and explosion mechanism(s) are still unclarified. Thanks to the recent development of transient observations, they are now frequently discovered shortly after the explosion, followed by rapid spectroscopic observations. In this study, by modeling very early-phase spectra of SNe Ia, we try to constrain the explosion models of SNe Ia. By using the Monte Carlo radiation transfer code, TARDIS, we estimate the properties of their outermost ejecta. We find that the photospheric velocity of normal-velocity supernovae (NV SNe) in the first week is {$\sim$}15000 km s-1. The outer velocity, to which the carbon burning extends, spans the range between {$\sim$}20000 and 25000 km s-1. The ejecta density of NV SNe also shows a large diversity. For high-velocity supernovae (HV SNe) and 1999aa-like SNe, the photospheric velocity is higher, {$\sim$}20000 km s-1. They are different in the photospheric density, with HV SNe having higher density than 1999aa-like SNe. For all these types, we show that the outermost composition is closely related to the outermost ejecta density; the carbon burning layer and the unburnt carbon layer are found in the higher-density and lower-density objects, respectively. This finding suggests that there might be two sequences, the highdensity and carbon-poor group (HV SNe and some NV SNe) and the low-density and carbon-rich group (1999aa-like and other NV SNe), which may be associated with different progenitor channels.},

However, the relatively crude angular resolution of GALEX (5{${'}{'}$}) made its images susceptible to blending of sources, resulting in potentially biased far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) pipeline photometry. To remedy this issue and take advantage of model-fit photometry, we use the EMphot software to obtain forced GALEX photometry for {$\sim$}700,000 SDSS galaxies at z{$<$} 0.3. Positional priors of target galaxies and potentially contaminating neighbors were taken from SDSS. New photometry is based on the best-fitting of three model profiles: optical-like, exponential and flat. New photometry mitigates blending present in the original pipeline catalogs, which affected 16\% of galaxies at a level of {$>$} 0.2 mag and 2\% at a level of {$>$} 1 mag. Pipeline NUV magnitudes are severely affected ({$\greaterequivlnt$} 1 mag) when the neighbor is brighter than the target galaxy and within 10{${'}{'}$}, or when the neighbor is fainter and within {$\sim$}3{${'}{'}$} of the target. New photometry fixes edge-of-detector bias, which affected pipeline photometry by up to 0.1 mag in NUV. We present catalogs with new photometry for GALEX observations of different depths, corresponding to the all-sky imaging survey (AIS), medium imaging survey (MIS) and deep imaging survey (DIS). Catalogs feature combined magnitudes for multiple detections of the same galaxy in a survey.},

In addition to the well-studied \$5\textbackslash sigma\$ challenge of \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM (the Hubble \$H\_0\$ tension) and other well known tensions (the growth tension, and the lensing amplitude \$A\_L\$ anomaly), we discuss a wide range of other less discussed less-standard signals which appear at a lower statistical significance level than the \$H\_0\$ tension some of them known as 'curiosities' in the data) which may also constitute hints towards new physics. For example such signals include cosmic dipoles (the fine structure constant \$\textbackslash alpha\$, velocity and quasar dipoles), CMB asymmetries, BAO Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ tension, age of the Universe issues, the Lithium problem, small scale curiosities like the core-cusp and missing satellite problems, quasars Hubble diagram, oscillating short range gravity signals etc. The goal of this pedagogical review is to collectively present the current status (2022 update) of these signals and their level of significance, with emphasis on the Hubble tension and refer to recent resources where more details can be found for each signal. We also briefly discuss theoretical approaches that can potentially explain some of these signals.},

  abstract = {A number of challenges to the standard \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model have been emerging during the past few years as the accuracy of cosmological observations improves. In this review we discuss in a unified manner many existing signals in cosmological and astrophysical data that appear to be in some tension (\$2\textbackslash sigma\$ or larger) with the standard \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model as specified by the Cosmological Principle, General Relativity and the Planck18 parameter values. In addition to the well-studied \$5\textbackslash sigma\$ challenge of \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM (the Hubble \$H\_0\$ tension) and other well known tensions (the growth tension, and the lensing amplitude \$A\_L\$ anomaly), we discuss a wide range of other less discussed less-standard signals which appear at a lower statistical significance level than the \$H\_0\$ tension some of them known as 'curiosities' in the data) which may also constitute hints towards new physics. For example such signals include cosmic dipoles (the fine structure constant \$\textbackslash alpha\$, velocity and quasar dipoles), CMB asymmetries, BAO Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ tension, age of the Universe issues, the Lithium problem, small scale curiosities like the core-cusp and missing satellite problems, quasars Hubble diagram, oscillating short range gravity signals etc. The goal of this pedagogical review is to collectively present the current status (2022 update) of these signals and their level of significance, with emphasis on the Hubble tension and refer to recent resources where more details can be found for each signal. We also briefly discuss theoretical approaches that can potentially explain some of these signals.},

  abstract = {We report measurements of the mass density, Omega\_M, and cosmological-constant energy density, Omega\_Lambda, of the universe based on the analysis of 42 Type Ia supernovae discovered by the Supernova Cosmology Project. The magnitude-redshift data for these SNe, at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83, are fit jointly with a set of SNe from the Calan/Tololo Supernova Survey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological parameters. All SN peak magnitudes are standardized using a SN Ia lightcurve width-luminosity relation. The measurement yields a joint probability distribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by the relation 0.8 Omega\_M - 0.6 Omega\_Lambda \textasciitilde = -0.2 +/- 0.1 in the region of interest (Omega\_M {$<\sptilde$} 1.5). For a flat (Omega\_M + Omega\_Lambda = 1) cosmology we find Omega\_M = 0.28\{+0.09,-0.08\} (1 sigma statistical) \{+0.05,-0.04\} (identified systematics). The data are strongly inconsistent with a Lambda = 0 flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. An open, Lambda = 0 cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological constant is non-zero and positive, with a confidence of P(Lambda {$>$} 0) = 99\%, including the identified systematic uncertainties. The best-fit age of the universe relative to the Hubble time is t\_0 = 14.9\{+1.4,-1.1\} (0.63/h) Gyr for a flat cosmology. The size of our sample allows us to perform a variety of statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We find no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution or Malmquist bias between the low-redshift Calan/Tololo sample and our high-redshift sample. The conclusions are robust whether or not a width-luminosity relation is used to standardize the SN peak magnitudes.},

As systematics become the main contributors to the error budget, it has become imperative to expand supernova cosmology analyses to include a more general likelihood to model systematics to remove biases with losses in precision. To illustrate an example likelihood analysis, we use a simple model of two populations with a relative luminosity shift, independent intrinsic dispersions, and linear redshift evolution of the relative fraction of each population. Treating observationally viable two-population mock data using a one-population model results in an inferred dark energy equation of state parameter w that is biased by roughly 2 times its statistical error for a sample of N  2500 SNeIa. Modeling the two-population data with a two-population model removes this bias at a cost of an approximately \textasciitilde 20\% increase in the statistical constraint on w. These significant biases can be realized even if the support for two underlying SNeIa populations, in the form of model selection criteria, is inconclusive. With the current observationally estimated difference in the two proposed populations, a sample of N  10,000 SNeIa is necessary to yield conclusive evidence of two populations.},

We convert all observations to a common calibration and find a remarkable consensus on the variation of the MS shape and normalization across cosmic time. The relation exhibits a curvature towards the high stellar masses at all redshifts. The best functional form is governed by two parameters: the evolution of the normalization and the turnover mass ({$\mathsl{M}$}0 ({$\mathsl{t}$})), which both evolve as a power law of the Universe age. The turn-over mass determines the MS shape. It marginally evolves with time, making the MS slightly steeper towards {$\mathsl{z}$} {$\sim$} 4 - 6. At stellar masses below {$\mathsl{M}$}0 ({$\mathsl{t}$}), SFGs have a constant specific SFR (sSFR), while above {$\mathsl{M}$}0 ({$\mathsl{t}$}) the sSFR is suppressed. We find that the MS is dominated by central galaxies. This allows to turn {$\mathsl{M}$}0 ({$\mathsl{t}$}) into the corresponding host halo mass. This evolves as the halo mass threshold between cold and hot accretion regimes, as predicted by the theory of accretion, where the central galaxy is fed or starved of cold gas supply, respectively. We, thus, argue that the progressive MS bending as a function of the Universe age is caused by the lower availability of cold gas in halos entering the hot accretion phase, in addition to black hole feedback. We also find qualitatively the same trend in the largest sample of star-forming galaxies provided by the IllustrisTNG simulation. Nevertheless, we still note large quantitative discrepancies with respect to observations, in particular at the high mass end. These can not be easily ascribed to biases or systematics in the observed SFRs and the derived MS.},

There is a growing number of analyses that show that photometric samples can be utilised for precision cosmological studies with minimal systematic uncertainties. To investigate this claim, we perform the first analysis that combines two separate photometric samples, SDSS and Pan-STARRS, without including a low-redshift anchor. We evaluate the consistency of the cosmological parameters from these two samples and find they are consistent with each other to under 1{$\sigma$}. From the combined sample, named Amalgame, we measure {$\Omega$}M = 0.328 {$\pm$} 0.024 with SN alone in a flat {$\Lambda$}CDM model, and {$\Omega$}M = 0.330 {$\pm$} 0.018 and w = -1.016+-00..005558 when combining with a Planck data prior and a flat wCDM model. These results are consistent with constraints from the Pantheon+ analysis of only spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia, and show that there are no significant impediments to analyses of purely photometric samples of SNe Ia.},

EDE refers to a new form of dark energy active at early times (typically a scalar-field), that quickly dilutes away at a redshift close to matter-radiation equality. The role of EDE is to decrease the sound horizon by briefly contributing to the Hubble rate in the pre-recombination era. We summarize the results of several analyses of EDE models suggested thus far in light of recent cosmological data, including constraints from the canonical \{\textbackslash it Planck\} data, baryonic acoustic oscillations and Type Ia supernovae, and the more recent hints driven by cosmic microwave background observations using the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. We also discuss potential challenges to EDE models, from theoretical ones (a second ``cosmic coincidence'' problem in particular) to observational ones, related to the amplitude of clustering on scales of \$8h\$/Mpc as measured by weak-lensing observables (the so-called \$S\_8\$ tension) and the galaxy power spectrum from BOSS analyzed through the effective field theory of large-scale structure. We end by reviewing recent attempts at addressing these shortcomings of the EDE proposal. While current data remain inconclusive on the existence of an EDE phase, we stress that given the signatures of EDE models imprinted in the CMB and matter power spectra, next-generation experiments can firmly establish whether EDE is the mechanism responsible for the Hubble tension and distinguish between the various models suggested in the literature.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in deep learning have shown their ability to learn strong feature representations for images. The task of image clustering naturally requires good feature representations to capture the distribution of the data and subsequently differentiate data points from one another. Often these two aspects are dealt with independently and thus traditional feature learning alone does not suffice in partitioning the data meaningfully. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) naturally lend themselves to learning data distributions in a latent space. Since we wish to efficiently discriminate between different clusters in the data, we propose a method based on VAEs where we use a Gaussian Mixture prior to help cluster the images accurately. We jointly learn the parameters of both the prior and the posterior distributions. Our method represents a true Gaussian Mixture VAE. This way, our method simultaneously learns a prior that captures the latent distribution of the images and a posterior to help discriminate well between data points. We also propose a novel reparametrization of the latent space consisting of a mixture of discrete and continuous variables. One key takeaway is that our method generalizes better across different datasets without using any pre-training or learnt models, unlike existing methods, allowing it to be trained from scratch in an end-to-end manner. We verify our efficacy and generalizability experimentally by achieving state-of-the-art results among unsupervised methods on a variety of datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to pursue image clustering using VAEs in a purely unsupervised manner on real image datasets.},

  abstract = {Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) are widely used to measure distances in the Universe. Despite the recent progress achieved in SN Ia standardization, the Hubble diagram still shows some remaining intrinsic dispersion. The remaining scatter in supernova luminosity could be due to the environmental effects that are accounted for as mass step correction in the current cosmological analyses. In this work, we compare the local and global colour (U - V), the local star formation rate, and the host stellar mass to the host galaxy morphology. The observed trends suggest that the host galaxy morphology is a relevant parameter to characterize the SN Ia environment. Therefore, we study the influence of host galaxy morphology on light-curve parameters of SNe Ia from the PANTHEON cosmological supernova sample. We determine the Hubble morphological type of host galaxies for a subsample of 330 SNe Ia. We confirm that the SALT2 stretch parameter x1 depends on the host morphology with the p-value {$\sim$}10-14. The supernovae with lower stretch value are hosted mainly by elliptical and lenticular galaxies. No correlation for the SALT2 colour parameter c is found. We also examine Hubble diagram residuals for supernovae hosted by `early-type' and `late-type' morphological groups of galaxies. The analysis reveals that the mean distance modulus residual in early-type galaxies is smaller than the one in late-type galaxies, which means that early-type galaxies contain brighter supernovae after stretch and colour corrections. However, we do not observe any difference in the residual dispersion for these two morphological groups. The obtained results are in the line with other analyses showing environmental dependence of SN Ia light-curve parameters and luminosity. We confirm the importance of including a host galaxy parameter into the standardization procedure of SNe Ia for further cosmological studies.},

  abstract = {Redshift measurements, primarily obtained from host galaxies, are essential for inferring cosmological parameters from type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Matching SNe to host galaxies using images is nontrivial, resulting in a subset of SNe with mismatched hosts and thus incorrect redshifts. We evaluate the host galaxy mismatch rate and resulting biases on cosmological parameters from simulations modeled after the Dark Energy Survey 5-Year (DES-SN5YR) photometric sample. For both DES-SN5YR data and simulations, we employ the directional light radius method for host galaxy matching. In our SN Ia simulations, we find that 1.7\% of SNe are matched to the wrong host galaxy, with redshift difference between the true and matched host of up to 0.6. Using our analysis pipeline, we determine the shift in the dark energy equation of state parameter ({$\increment$}w) due to including SNe with incorrect host galaxy matches. For SN Ia-only simulations, we find {$\increment$}w = 0.0013 {$\pm$} 0.0026 with constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Including core-collapse SNe and peculiar SNe Ia in the simulation, we find that {$\increment$}w ranges from 0.0009 to 0.0032 depending on the photometric classifier used. This bias is an order of magnitude smaller than the expected total uncertainty on w from the DES-SN5YR sample of {$\sim$} 0.03. We conclude that the bias on w from host galaxy mismatch is much smaller than the uncertainties expected from the DES-SN5YR sample, but we encourage further studies to reduce this bias through better host-matching algorithms or selection cuts.},

  abstract = {We present grizP1 light curves of 146 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia; 0.03 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.65) discovered during the first 1.5 yr of the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey. The Pan-STARRS1 natural photometric system is determined by a combination of on-site measurements of the instrument response function and observations of spectrophotometric standard stars. We find that the systematic uncertainties in the photometric system are currently 1.2\% without accounting for the uncertainty in the Hubble Space Telescope Calspec definition of the AB system. A Hubble diagram is constructed with a subset of 113 out of 146 SNe Ia that pass our light curve quality cuts. The cosmological fit to 310 SNe Ia (113 PS1 SNe Ia + 222 light curves from 197 low-z SNe Ia), using only supernovae (SNe) and assuming a constant dark energy equation of state and flatness, yields w = -1.120+-00..326006(Stat)+-00..226991(Sys). When combined with BAO+CMB(Planck)+H0, the analysis yields {$\Omega$}M = 0.280+-00..001132 and w = -1.166+-00..007629 including all identified systematics. The value of w is inconsistent with the cosmological constant value of -1 at the 2.3{$\sigma$} level. Tension endures after removing either the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) or the H0 constraint, though it is strongest when including the H0 constraint. If we include WMAP9 cosmic microwave background (CMB) constraints instead of those from Planck, we find w = -1.124+-00..008635, which diminishes the discord to {$<$}2{$\sigma$} . We cannot conclude whether the tension with flat {$\Lambda$}CDM is a feature of dark energy, new physics, or a combination of chance and systematic errors. The full Pan-STARRS1 SN sample with {$\sim$}three times as many SNe should provide more conclusive results.},

  abstract = {Euclid and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) are poised to dramatically change the astronomy landscape early in the next decade. The combination of high-cadence, deep, wide-field optical photometry from LSST with highresolution, wide-field optical photometry, and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy from Euclid will be powerful for addressing a wide range of astrophysical questions. We explore Euclid/LSST synergy, ignoring the political issues associated with data access to focus on the scientific, technical, and financial benefits of coordination. We focus primarily on dark energy cosmology, but also discuss galaxy evolution, transient objects, solar system science, and galaxy cluster studies. We concentrate on synergies that require coordination in cadence or survey overlap, or would benefit from pixellevel co-processing that is beyond the scope of what is currently planned, rather than scientific programs that could be accomplished only at the catalog level without coordination in data processing or survey strategies. We provide two quantitative examples of scientific synergies: the decrease in photo-z errors (benefiting many science cases) when highresolution Euclid data are used for LSST photo-z determination, and the resulting increase in weak-lensing signal-to-noise ratio from smaller photo-z errors. We briefly discuss other areas of coordination, including high-performance computing resources and calibration data. Finally, we address concerns about the loss of independence and potential cross-checks between the two missions and the potential consequences of not collaborating.},

We present JWST NIRCAM observations in two epochs and three filters of {$>$}320 Cepheids in NGC 4258 (which has a 1.5\% maser-based geometric distance) and in NGC 5584 (host of SN Ia 2007af), near the median distance of the SH0ES HST SN Ia host sample and with the best leverage among them to detect such a bias. JWST provides far superior source separation from line-of-sight companions than HST in the NIR to largely negate confusion or crowding noise at these wavelengths, where extinction is minimal. The result is a remarkable {$>$}2.5\texttimes{} reduction in the dispersion of the Cepheid P \textendash L relations, from 0.45 to 0.17 mag, improving individual Cepheid precision from 20\% to 7\%. Two-epoch photometry confirmed identifications, tested JWST photometric stability, and constrained Cepheid phases. The P \textendash L relation intercepts are in very good agreement, with differences (JWST-HST) of 0.00{$\pm$}0.03 and 0.02{$\pm$}0.03 mag for NGC 4258 and NGC 5584, respectively. The difference in the determination of H0 between HST and JWST from these intercepts is 0.02{$\pm$}0.04 mag, insensitive to JWST zeropoints or count-rate non-linearity thanks to error cancellation between rungs. We explore a broad range of analysis variants (including passband combinations, phase corrections, measured detector offsets, and crowding levels) indicating robust baseline results. These observations provide the strongest evidence yet that systematic errors in HST Cepheid photometry do not play a significant role in the present Hubble Tension. Upcoming JWST observations of {$>$}12 SN Ia hosts should further refine the local measurement of the Hubble constant.},

  abstract = {The Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) was a multi-cycle treasury program on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that surveyed a total area of {$\sim$}0.25 deg2 with {$\sim$}900 HST orbits spread across five fields over three years. Within these survey images we discovered 65 supernovae (SNe) of all types, out to z {$\sim$} 2.5. We classify {$\sim$}24 of these as Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) based on host galaxy redshifts and SN photometry (supplemented by grism spectroscopy of six SNe). Here we present a measurement of the volumetric SN Ia rate as a function of redshift, reaching for the first time beyond z = 2 and putting new constraints on SN Ia progenitor models. Our highest redshift bin includes detections of SNe that exploded when the universe was only {$\sim$}3 Gyr old and near the peak of the cosmic star formation history. This gives the CANDELS high redshift sample unique leverage for evaluating the fraction of SNe Ia that explode promptly after formation ({$<$}500 Myr). Combining the CANDELS rates with all available SN Ia rate measurements in the literature we find that this prompt SN Ia fraction is fP = 0.53sta{$\pm$}t00..1009sy{$\pm$}s00..2160, consistent with a delay time distribution that follows a simple t-1 power law for all times t {$>$} 40 Myr. However, mild tension is apparent between ground-based low-z surveys and space-based high-z surveys. In both CANDELS and the sister HST program CLASH (Cluster Lensing And Supernova Survey with Hubble), we find a low rate of SNe Ia at z {$>$} 1. This could be a hint that prompt progenitors are in fact relatively rare, accounting for only 20\% of all SN Ia explosions\textemdash though further analysis and larger samples will be needed to examine that suggestion.},

  abstract = {We present a fully consistent catalog of local and global properties of host galaxies of 882 Type Ia supernov\ae{} (SNIa) that were selected based on their light-curve properties, spanning the redshift range 0.01 {$<$} z {$<$} 1. This catalog corresponds to a preliminary version of the compilation sample and includes Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) 5-year data, Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and lowredshift surveys. We measured low- and moderate-redshift host galaxy photometry in SDSS stacked and single-epoch images and used spectral energy distribution fitting techniques to derive host properties such as stellar mass and U - V rest-frame colors; the latter are an indicator of the luminosity-weighted age of the stellar population in a galaxy. We combined these results with high-redshift host photometry from the SNLS survey and thus obtained a consistent catalog of host stellar masses and colors across a wide redshift range. We also estimated the local observed fluxes at the supernova location within a proper distance radius of 3 kpc, corresponding to the SNLS imaging resolution, and transposed them into local U - V rest-frame colors. This is the first time that local environments surrounding SNIa have been measured at redshifts spanning the entire Hubble diagram. Selecting SNIa based on host photometry quality, we then performed cosmological fits using local color as a third standardization variable, for which we split the sample at the median value. We find a local color step significance of -0.091 {$\pm$} 0.013 mag (7{$\sigma$}), which effect is as significant as the maximum mass step effect. This indicates that the remaining luminosity variations in SNIa samples can be reduced with a third standardization variable that takes the environment into account. Correcting for the maximum mass step correction of -0.094 {$\pm$} 0.013 mag, we find a local color effect of -0.057 {$\pm$} 0.012 mag (5{$\sigma$}), which shows that additional information is provided by the close environment of SNIa. Departures from the initial choices were investigated and showed that the local color effect is still present, although less pronounced. We discuss the possible implications for cosmology and find that using the local color in place of the stellar mass results in a change in the measured value of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter of 0.6\%. Standardization using local U - V color in addition to stretch and color reduces the total dispersion in the Hubble diagram from 0.15 to 0.14 mag. This will be of tremendous importance for the forthcoming SNIa surveys, and in particular for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), for which uncertainties on the dark energy equation of state will be comparable to the effects reported here.},

Type Ia supernova explosions (meaning thermonuclear disruption of a white dwarf) are observed to be widely diverse in peak luminosity, lightcurve width and shape, spectral features, and host stellar population environment. In the last decade alone, theoretical simulations and observational data have come together to seriously challenge the long-standing paradigm that all SNe Ia arise from explosions of Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs. In this review I highlight some of the major developments (and changing views) of our understanding of the nature of SN Ia progenitor systems. I give a brief overview of binary star configurations and their plausible explosion mechanisms, and infer links between some of the various (observationally-categorized) SN Ia sub-classes and their progenitor origins from a theoretical standpoint.},

Parameters are estimated in a statistical way by comparing each observed broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) (two GALEX and five SDSS bands) with an extensive library of model galaxy SEDs, which cover a wide range of star formation histories and include stochastic starbursts. We compare the constraints derived using SDSS bands only with those derived using the combination of SDSS and GALEX photometry. We find that the addition of the GALEX bands leads to significant improvement in the estimation of both the dust optical depth and the star formation rate over timescales of 100 Myr to 1 Gyr in a galaxy. We attain sensitivity to SFRs as low as 10Ϫ3 M, yrϪ1, and we find that low levels of star formation (SF) are mostly associated with early-type, red galaxies. The least massive galaxies have ratios of current to past-averaged SF rates (b-parameter) consistent with constant SF over a Hubble time. For late-type galaxies, this ratio on average decreases with mass. We find that b correlates tightly with NUV Ϫ r color, implying that the SF history of a galaxy can be constrained on the basis of the NUV Ϫ r color alone. The fraction of galaxies that have undergone a significant starburst episode within the last 1 Gyr steeply declines with mass, from {$\sim$}20\% for galaxies with {$\sim$}108 M, to {$\sim$}5\% for {$\sim$}1011 M, galaxies.},

We use data from the APOGEE spectroscopic survey in combination with ten-band photometry from Pan-STARRS1, the Two Micron All-Sky Survey, and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. We find that the extinction curve in the optical through infrared is well characterized by a one-parameter family of curves described by R(V). The extinction curve is more uniform than suggested in past works, with s (R (V )) = 0.18, and with less than one percent of sight lines having R (V ) {$>$} 4. Our data and analysis have revealed two new aspects of Galactic extinction: first, we find significant, wide-area variations in R(V) throughout the Galactic plane. These variations are on scales much larger than individual molecular clouds, indicating that R(V) variations must trace much more than just grain growth in dense molecular environments. Indeed, we find no correlation between R(V) and dust column density up to E (B - V ) \guillemotright{} 2. Second, we discover a strong relationship between R(V) and the far-infrared dust emissivity.},

A plethora of photo-z PDF estimation methodologies abound, producing discrepant results with no consensus on a preferred approach. We present the results of a comprehensive experiment comparing 12 photo-z algorithms applied to mock data produced for The Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time Dark Energy Science Collaboration. By supplying perfect prior information, in the form of the complete template library and a representative training set as inputs to each code, we demonstrate the impact of the assumptions underlying each technique on the output photo-z PDFs. In the absence of a notion of true, unbiased photo-z PDFs, we evaluate and interpret multiple metrics of the ensemble properties of the derived photo-z PDFs as well as traditional reductions to photo-z point estimates. We report systematic biases and overall over/underbreadth of the photo-z PDFs of many popular codes, which may indicate avenues for improvement in the algorithms or implementations. Furthermore, we raise attention to the limitations of established metrics for assessing photo-z PDF accuracy; though we identify the conditional density estimate loss as a promising metric of photo-z PDF performance in the case where true redshifts are available but true photo-z PDFs are not, we emphasize the need for science-specific performance metrics.},

We detail improvements to the PS1 SN photometry, astrometry and calibration that reduce the systematic uncertainties in the PS1 SN Ia distances. We combine the subset of 276 PS1 SN Ia (0.03 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.65) with useful distance estimates of SN Ia from SDSS, SNLS, various low-z and HST samples to form the largest combined sample of SN Ia consisting of a total of 1049 SN Ia ranging from 0.01 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.3, which we call the `Pantheon Sample'. Photometric calibration uncertainties have long dominated the systematic error budget of every major analysis of cosmological parameters with SN Ia. We have reduced these calibration systematics to the point where they are similar in magnitude to the other major sources of known systematic uncertainties: the nature of the intrinsic scatter of SN Ia and modeling of selection effects. When combining Planck 2015 CMB measurements with the Pantheon SN sample, we find {$\Omega$}m = 0.306 {$\pm$} 0.012 and w = -1.031 {$\pm$} 0.040 for the wCDM model. When the SN and CMB constraints are combined with constraints from BAO and local H0 measurements, the analysis yields the most precise measurement of dark energy to date: w0 = -1.011 {$\pm$} 0.087 and wa = -0.215 {$\pm$} 0.402 for the w0waCDM model. Tension with a cosmological constant previously seen in an analysis of PS1 and low-z SNe has diminished after an increase of 2\texttimes{} in the statistics of the PS1 sample, improved calibration and photometry, and stricter light-curve quality cuts. We find the systematic uncertainties in our measurements of dark energy are almost as large as the statistical uncertainties, primarily due to limitations of modeling the low-redshift sample. This must be addressed for future progress in using SN Ia to measure dark energy.},

This effort is one part of a series of works that perform an extensive review of redshifts, peculiar velocities, photometric calibration, and intrinsic-scatter models of SNe Ia. The total number of light curves, which are compiled across 18 different surveys, is a significant increase from the first Pantheon analysis (1048 SNe), particularly at low redshift (\$z\$). Furthermore, unlike in the Pantheon analysis, we include light curves for SNe with \$z{$<$}0.01\$ such that SN systematic covariance can be included in a joint measurement of the Hubble constant (H\$\_0\$) and the dark energy equation-of-state parameter (\$w\$). We use the large sample to compare properties of 151 SNe Ia observed by multiple surveys and 12 pairs/triplets of "SN siblings" - SNe found in the same host galaxy. Distance measurements, application of bias corrections, and inference of cosmological parameters are discussed in the companion paper by Brout et al. (2022b), and the determination of H\$\_0\$ is discussed by Riess et al. (2022).

  abstract = {Current cosmological analyses, which use Type Ia supernova observations, combine supernova (SN) samples to expand the redshift range beyond that of a single sample and increase the overall sample size. The inhomogeneous photometric calibration between different SN samples is one of the largest systematic uncertainties of the cosmological parameter estimation. To place these different samples on a single system, analyses currently use observations of a small sample of very bright flux standards on the Hubble Space Telescope system. We propose a complementary method, called ``Supercal,'' in which we use measurements of secondary standards in each system, compare these to measurements of the same stars in the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) system, and determine the offsets for each system relative to PS1, placing all SN observations on a single, consistent photometric system. PS1 has observed 3{$\pi$} of the sky and has a relative calibration of better than 5 mmag (for {$\sim$}15{$<$}griz{$<$}21 mag), making it an ideal reference system. We use this process to recalibrate optical observations taken by the following SN samples: PS1, Supernova Legacy Survey, SDSS, CSP, and CfA1-4. We measure discrepancies on average of 10 mmag, but up to 35 mmag, in various optical passbands. We find that correcting for these differences changes the recovered values for the dark energy equation of state parameter, w, by an average of 2.6\%. This change is roughly half the size of current statistical constraints on w. The size of this effect strongly depends on the error in the B - V calibration of the low-z surveys. The Supercal method will allow future analyses to tie past samples to the best calibrated sample.},

  abstract = {Variational auto-encoders (VAEs) are a powerful approach to unsupervised learning. They enable scalable approximate posterior inference in latent-variable models using variational inference (VI). A VAE posits a variational family parameterized by a deep neural network called an encoder that takes data as input. This encoder is shared across all the observations, which amortizes the cost of inference. However the encoder of a VAE has the undesirable property that it maps a given observation and a semantics-preserving transformation of it to different latent representations. This "inconsistency" of the encoder lowers the quality of the learned representations, especially for downstream tasks, and also negatively affects generalization. In this paper, we propose a regularization method to enforce consistency in VAEs. The idea is to minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the variational distribution when conditioning on the observation and the variational distribution when conditioning on a random semantic-preserving transformation of this observation. This regularization is applicable to any VAE. In our experiments we apply it to four different VAE variants on several benchmark datasets and found it always improves the quality of the learned representations but also leads to better generalization. In particular, when applied to the Nouveau Variational Auto-Encoder (NVAE), our regularization method yields state-of-the-art performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10. We also applied our method to 3D data and found it learns representations of superior quality as measured by accuracy on a downstream classification task.},

  abstract = {Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Supernova Survey-II (SDSS-II SN Survey), we measure the rate of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as a function of galaxy properties at intermediate redshift. A sample of 342 SNe Ia with 0.05 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.25 is constructed. Using broadband photometry and redshifts, we use the PE\textasciiacute{} GASE.2 spectral energy distributions to estimate host galaxy stellar masses and recent star formation rates (SFRs). We find that the rate of SNe Ia per unit stellar mass is significantly higher (by a factor of {$\sim$}30) in highly star-forming galaxies compared to passive galaxies. When parameterizing the SN Ia rate (SNRIa) based on host galaxy properties, we find that the rate of SNe Ia in passive galaxies is not linearly proportional to the stellar mass; instead an SNRIa {$\propto$} M0.68 is favored. However, such a parameterization does not describe the observed SNRIa in star-forming galaxies. The SNRIa in star-forming galaxies is well fitted by SNRIa = (0.41 {$\pm$} 0.15) \texttimes{} 10-10M0.72{$\pm$}0.15 + (0.65 {$\pm$} 0.25) \texttimes{} 10-3SFR1.01{$\pm$}0.22 (statistical errors only), where M is the host galaxy stellar mass (in M ) and SFR is the SFR (in M yr-1). We show that our results, for SNe Ia in passive galaxies, are consistent with those at higher redshifts (favoring SNRIa {$\propto$} M) when accounting for the difference in the ages of our galaxies. This suggests that the rate of SNe Ia is correlated with the age of the stellar population. The MLCS extinction parameter, AV , is similar in passive and moderately star-forming galaxies, but we find indications that it is smaller, on average, in highly star-forming galaxies. This result appears to be driven by a deficit of the reddest (AV {$>$} 0.15) SNe Ia in highly star-forming galaxies. We consider that the high levels of dust in these systems may be obscuring the reddest and faintest SNe Ia.},

  abstract = {While gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens from neutron star (NS) mergers have been proposed to offer good measurements of the Hubble constant, we show in this paper how a variation of the expanding photosphere method (EPM) or spectral-fitting expanding atmosphere method, applied to the kilonovae (KNe) associated with the mergers, can provide an independent and potentially percent-accurate distance measurement to individual mergers. The KN-EPM overcomes the major uncertainties commonly associated with this method in supernovae for four reasons: 1) the early continuum is very well-reproduced by a blackbody spectrum, 2) the dilution effect from electron scattering opacity is likely negligible, 3) the explosion times are exactly known due to the GW detection, and 4) the ejecta geometry is, at least in some cases, highly spherical and can be constrained from line-shape analysis. We provide an analysis of the early VLT/X-shooter spectra AT2017gfo showing how the luminosity distance can be determined, and find a luminosity distance of DL = 44.5 {$\pm$} 0.5 Mpc in agreement with, but more precise than, previous methods. We investigate the dominant systematic uncertainties, but our simple framework, which assumes a blackbody photosphere, does not account for the full time-dependent, three-dimensional radiative transfer effects, so this distance should be treated as preliminary. The luminosity distance corresponds to an estimated Hubble constant of H0 = 67.1 {$\pm$} 3.4 km s-1 Mpc-1, where the dominant uncertainty is due to the modelling of the host peculiar velocity. We also estimate the expected constraints on H0 from future KN-EPM-analysis with the upcoming O4 and O5 runs of the LIGO collaboration GW-detectors, where 5\textendash 10 similar KNe would yield 1\% precision cosmological constraints.},

  abstract = {The mergers of neutron stars expel a heavy-element enriched fireball which can be observed as a kilonova. The kilonova's geometry is a key diagnostic of the merger and is dictated by the properties of ultra-dense matter and the energetics of the collapse to a black hole. Current hydrodynamical merger models typically show aspherical ejecta. Previously, Sr\$\^+\$ was identified in the spectrum of the the only well-studied kilonova AT2017gfo, associated with the gravitational wave event GW170817. Here we combine the strong Sr\$\^+\$ P Cygni absorption-emission spectral feature and the blackbody nature of kilonova spectrum, to determine that the kilonova is highly spherical at early epochs. Line shape analysis combined with the known inclination angle of the source also shows the same sphericity independently. We conclude that energy injection by radioactive decay is insufficient to make the ejecta spherical. A magnetar wind or jet from the black hole disk could inject enough energy to induce a more spherical distribution in the overall ejecta, however an additional process seems necessary to make the element distribution uniform},

Maurizio Spurio gives very clear presentations using a generous amount of observational data. " James Matthews (Louisiana State University) This is the second edition of an introduction to "multi-messenger" astrophysics. It covers the many different aspects connecting particle physics with astrophysics and cosmology and introduces high-energy astrophysics using different probes: the electromagnetic radiation, with techniques developed by traditional astronomy; charged cosmic rays, gamma-rays and neutrinos, with methods developed in high-energy laboratories; and gravitational waves, recently observed using laser interferometers. The book offers a comprehensive and systematic approach to the theoretical background and the experimental aspects of the study of the high-energy universe. The breakthrough discovery of gravitational waves motivated this new edition of the book, to offer a more global and multimessenger vision of high-energy astrophysics. This second edition is updated and enriched with substantial new materials also deriving from the results obtained at the LIGO/Virgo observatories. For the first time it is now possible to draw the connection between gravitational waves, traditional astronomical observations and other probes (in particular, gamma-rays and neutrinos). The book draws on the extensive courses of Professor Maurizio Spurio at the University of Bologna and it is aimed at graduate students and post-graduate researchers with a basic understanding of particle and nuclear physics. It will also be of interest to particle physicists working in accelerator/collider physics who are keen to understand the mechanisms of the largest accelerators in the Universe},

We adopt a flexible skewnormal DTD model, which could match a wide range of physically motivated DTD forms. We find a family of solutions that are essentially exponential DTDs, similar in shape to the {$\beta$} {$\approx$} -1 power-law DTDs, but with more delayed events ({$>$} 1 Gyr in age) than prompt events ({$<$} 1 Gyr). Comparing these solutions to delay time measures separately derived from field galaxies and galaxy clusters, we find the skew-normal solutions can accommodate both without requiring a different DTD form in different environments. These model fits are generally inconsistent with results from single-degenerate binary population synthesis models, and are seemingly supportive of double-degenerate progenitors for most SN Ia events.},

  abstract = {We study the evolution of the star formation rate (SFR) \textendash{} stellar mass (M ) relation and specific star formation rate (sSFR) of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) since a redshift z 5.5 using 2435 (4531) galaxies with highly reliable spectroscopic redshifts in the VIMOS Ultra-Deep Survey (VUDS). It is the first time that these relations can be followed over such a large redshift range from a single homogeneously selected sample of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. The log(SFR) - log(M ) relation for SFGs remains roughly linear all the way up to z = 5, but the SFR steadily increases at fixed mass with increasing redshift. We find that for stellar masses M {$\geq$} 3.2 \texttimes{} 109 M the SFR increases by a factor of {$\sim$}13 between z = 0.4 and z = 2.3. We extend this relation up to z = 5, finding an additional increase in SFR by a factor of 1.7 from z = 2.3 to z = 4.8 for masses M {$\geq$} 1010 M . We observe a turn-off in the SFR\textendash M relation at the highest mass end up to a redshift z {$\sim$} 3.5. We interpret this turn-off as the signature of a strong on-going quenching mechanism and rapid mass growth. The sSFR increases strongly up to z {$\sim$} 2, but it grows much less rapidly in 2 {$<$} z {$<$} 5. We find that the shape of the sSFR evolution is not well reproduced by cold gas accretion-driven models or the latest hydrodynamical models. Below z {$\sim$} 2 these models have a flatter evolution (1 + z){$\Phi$} with {$\Phi$} = 2-2.25 compared to the data which evolves more rapidly with {$\Phi$} = 2.8 {$\pm$} 0.2. Above z {$\sim$} 2, the reverse is happening with the data evolving more slowly with {$\Phi$} = 1.2 {$\pm$} 0.1. The observed sSFR evolution over a large redshift range 0 {$<$} z {$<$} 5 and our finding of a non-linear main sequence at high mass both indicate that the evolution of SFR and M is not solely driven by gas accretion. The results presented in this paper emphasize the need to invoke a more complex mix of physical processes including major and minor merging to further understand the co-evolution of the SFR and stellar mass growth.},

Our Bayesian analysis simultaneously constrains the mass step and dust \$R\_V\$ population distribution by leveraging optical-NIR colour information. We demonstrate how a simplistic analysis where individual \$R\_V\$ values are first estimated for each SN separately, and then the sample variance of these point estimates is computed, overestimates the \$R\_V\$ population variance \$\textbackslash sigma\_R\^2\$. This bias is exacerbated when neglecting residual intrinsic colour variation beyond that due to light curve shape. Instead, Bayesian shrinkage estimates of \$\textbackslash sigma\_R\$ are more accurate, with fully hierarchical analysis of the light curves being ideal. For the 75 SNe with low-to-moderate reddening (peak apparent \$B-V\textbackslash leq0.3\$), we estimate an \$R\_V\$ distribution with population mean \$\textbackslash mu\_R=2.59\textbackslash pm0.14\$, and standard deviation \$\textbackslash sigma\_R=0.62\textbackslash pm0.16\$. Splitting this subsample at the median host galaxy mass (\$10\^\{10.57\}\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash odot\$) yields consistent estimated \$R\_V\$ distributions between low- and high-mass galaxies, with \$\textbackslash mu\_R=2.79\textbackslash pm0.18\$, \$\textbackslash sigma\_R=0.42\textbackslash pm0.24\$, and \$\textbackslash mu\_R=2.35\textbackslash pm0.27\$, \$\textbackslash sigma\_R=0.74\textbackslash pm0.36\$, respectively.

Splitting the population at the median host mass, we find RV = 2.84 {$\pm$} 0.31 in low-mass hosts, and RV = 2.58 {$\pm$} 0.23 in high-mass hosts, both consistent with the global value of RV = 2.61 {$\pm$} 0.21 that we estimate for the full sample.

  abstract = {We use the Dark Energy Survey (DES) 5 year catalogue of photometrically-classified type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to identify 70 SNe Ia that have occurred within red-sequence selected clusters of galaxies. We compare the cluster SN light-curve properties and environmental properties to 1020 DES SNe Ia located in the field, the largest comparison of two such samples to date. We find an tentative indication (98.5 per cent confidence level) that, on average, SNe Ia located in galaxy clusters are faster declining compared to those located in the field. We find no evidence of a difference in SN Ia colour between the two samples. Additionally, there is strong evidence (99.98 per cent confidence level) that cluster SNe Ia occur on average in more massive host galaxies than field SNe. We calculate the rate of SNe Ia per stellar mass in galaxy clusters, and find the average rate in the high mass (10 {$\leq$} log (M{${_\ast}$}/M ) {$\leq$} 11.25) cluster galaxies to be comparable to equivalent field mass galaxies, with an average difference of 1.3 {$\pm$} 0.3. Considering the full mass ranges of both samples, we measure a decrease in the overall rate per unit mass in the clusters compared to the field. Differences in the two samples rates could be caused by an excess of white dwarfs in clusters due to a different initial mass function, cluster galaxy mergers re-igniting star formation, or a difference in metallicity between the two environments.},

  abstract = {If, in addition to the usual luminosity correction described by the light curve slope parameter b, we introduce a color correction parameter R, then an extraordinarily good fit is realized for all the 29 distant Type Ia supernovae of the recent Cala\textasciiacute n/Tololo supernova survey. The reduced {$\chi$}2 found is much lower than can be expected. All of the intrinsic dispersion is thereby removed from the data sample, leaving perfectly standardized candles insofar as one can measure with present techniques. The best-fit solution has a mysteriously low value for R (referred to the B-band) of about 2 and a value of b {$\approx$} 0.5 which is smaller than previously reported without the color correction. These parameters lead, using pre-Hipparcos distances for Cepheid calibrations, to essentially the same value for the Hubble constant. Our preliminary value, subject to further investigation of Cepheid-calibrated supernovae using this same color correction, is H0 = 60 {$\pm$} 6 kms-1Mpc-1.},

The level starts from elementary notions, without assuming any previous knowledge of statistical methods, and then progresses to more advanced, research-level topics. After an introduction to the importance of statistical inference for the physical sciences, elementary notions of probability theory and inference are introduced and explained. Bayesian methods are then presented, starting from the meaning of Bayes Theorem and its use as inferential engine, including a discussion on priors and posterior distributions. Numerical methods for generating samples from arbitrary posteriors (including Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Nested Sampling) are then covered. The last section deals with the topic of Bayesian model selection and how it is used to assess the performance of models, and contrasts it with the classical p-value approach. A series of exercises of various levels of difficulty are designed to further the understanding of the theoretical material, including fully worked out solutions for most of them.},

  abstract = {For 100 years since galaxies were found to be flying apart from each other, astronomers have been trying to determine how fast. The expansion, characterized by the Hubble constant, H0, is confused locally by peculiar velocities caused by gravitational interactions, so observers must obtain accurate distances at significant redshifts. Very nearby in our Galaxy, accurate distances can be determined through stellar parallaxes. There is no good method for obtaining galaxy distances that is applicable from the near domain of stellar parallaxes to the far domain free from velocity anomalies. The recourse is the distance ladder involving multiple methods with overlapping domains. Good progress is being made on this project, with satisfactory procedures and linkages identified and tested across the necessary distance range. Best values of H0 from the distance ladder lie in the range 73 - 75 km s-1 Mpc-1. On the other hand, from detailed information available from the power spectrum of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, coupled with constraints favoring the existence of dark energy from distant supernova measurements, there is the precise prediction that H0 = 67.4 {$\pm$}1\%. If it is conclusively determined that the Hubble constant is well above 70 km s-1 Mpc-1 as indicated by distance ladder results then the current preferred {$\Lambda$} CDM cosmological model based on the Standard Model of particle physics may be incomplete. There is reason for optimism that the value of the Hubble constant from distance ladder observations will be rigorously defined with {$\sim$} 1\% accuracy in the near future.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) from both the Carnegie Supernova Project I (CSP-I) and II (CSP-II), and extend the Hubble diagram from the optical to the near-infrared wavelengths (uBgV riY JH). We calculate the Hubble constant, H0 using various distance calibrators: Cepheids, Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB), and Surface Brightness Fluctuations (SBF). Combining all methods of calibrations, we derive H0 = 71.43 {$\pm$} 0.62 (stat) {$\pm$} 2.43 (sys) km s-1 Mpc-1 from B-band, and H0 = 72.65 {$\pm$} 0.63 (stat) {$\pm$} 2.88 (sys) km s-1 Mpc-1 from H-band. By assigning equal weight to the Cepheid, TRGB, and SBF calibrators, we derive the systematic errors required for consistency in the first rung of the distance ladder, resulting in an increased systematic error in H0. As a result, the tension between the late-time H0 we derive by combining the various distance calibrators and the early-time H0 from the Cosmic Microwave Background is reduced. The highest precision in SN Ia luminosity is found in the Y band (0.12 {$\pm$} 0.01 mag), as defined by the intrinsic scatter ({$\sigma$}int). We revisit SN Ia Hubble residual-host mass correlations and recover previous results that these correlations do not change significantly between the optical and the near-infrared wavelengths. Finally, SNe Ia that explode beyond 10 kpc from their host centers exhibit smaller dispersion in their luminosity, confirming our earlier findings. Reduced effect of dust in the outskirt of hosts may be responsible for this effect.},

While being conceptually and computationally appealing, this method involves the problematic need to also split the prior for the local inferences; these weakened priors may not provide enough regularization for each separate computation, thus eliminating one of the key advantages of Bayesian methods. To resolve this dilemma while still retaining the generalizability of the underlying local inference method, we apply the idea of expectation propagation (EP) as a framework for distributed Bayesian inference. The central idea is to iteratively update approximations to the local likelihoods given the state of the other approximations and the prior.},

  abstract = {"The first sleep book by a leading scientific expert--Professor Matthew Walker, Director of UC Berkeley's Sleep and Neuroimaging Lab--reveals his groundbreaking exploration of sleep, explaining how we can harness its transformative power to change our lives for the better. Sleep is one of the most important but least understood aspects of our life, wellness, and longevity. Until very recently, science had no answer to the question of why we sleep, or what good it served, or why we suffer such devastating health consequences when we don't sleep. Compared to the other basic drives in life--eating, drinking, and reproducing--the purpose of sleep remained elusive. An explosion of scientific discoveries in the last twenty years has shed new light on this fundamental aspect of our lives. Now, preeminent neuroscientist and sleep expert Matthew Walker gives us a new understanding of the vital importance of sleep and dreaming. Within the brain, sleep enriches our ability to learn, memorize, and make logical decisions. It recalibrates our emotions, restocks our immune system, fine-tunes our metabolism, and regulates our appetite. Dreaming mollifies painful memories and creates a virtual reality space in which the brain melds past and present knowledge to inspire creativity. Walker answers important questions about sleep: how do caffeine and alcohol affect sleep? What really happens during REM sleep? Why do our sleep patterns change across a lifetime? How do common sleep aids affect us and can they do long-term damage? Charting cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs, and synthesizing decades of research and clinical practice, Walker explains how we can harness sleep to improve learning, mood, and energy levels; regulate hormones; prevent cancer, Alzheimer's, and diabetes; slow the effects of aging; increase longevity; enhance the education and lifespan of our children, and boost the efficiency, success, and productivity of our businesses. Clear-eyed, fascinating, and accessible, Why We Sleep is a crucial and illuminating book"--},

  abstract = {The exploration of the redshift drift, a direct measurement of cosmological expansion, is expected to take several decades of observation with stable, sensitive instruments. We introduced a new method to probe cosmology which bypasses the long-period observation by observing the redshift difference, an accumulation of the redshift drift, in multiple-image gravitational lens systems. With this, the photons observed in each image will have traversed through different paths between the source and the observer, and so the lensed images will show different redshifts when observed at the same instance. Here, we consider the impact of the underlying cosmology on the observed redshift difference in gravitational lens systems, generating synthetic data for realistic lens models and exploring the accuracy of determined cosmological parameters. We show that, whilst the redshift difference is sensitive to the densities of matter and dark energy within a universe, it is independent of the Hubble constant. Finally, we determine the observational considerations for using the redshift difference as a cosmological probe, finding that one thousand lensed sources are enough to make robust determinations of the underlying cosmological parameters. Upcoming cluster lens surveys, such as the Euclid, are expected to detect a sufficient number of such systems.},

  abstract = {Much of the research in supernova cosmology is based on an assumption that the peak luminosity of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), after a standardization process, is independent of the galactic environment. A series of recent studies suggested that there is a significant correlation between the standardized luminosity and the progenitor age of SNe Ia. The correlation found in the most recent work by Lee et al. is strong enough to explain the extra dimming of distant SNe Ia, and therefore casts doubts on the direct evidence of cosmic acceleration. The present work improves the previous work by incorporating the uncertainties of progenitor ages, which were ignored in Lee et al., into a fully Bayesian inference framework. We find a weaker dependence of supernova standardized luminosity on the progenitor age, but the detection of correlation remains significant (3.3{$\mathsl{\sigma}$}). Assuming that such correlation can be extended to high redshift and applying it to the Pantheon SN Ia data set, we find that the correlation cannot be the primary cause of the observed extra dimming of distant SNe Ia. Further more, we use the PAge formalism, which is a good approximation to many dark energy and modified gravity models, to do a model comparison. The concordance Lambda cold dark matter model remains a good fit when the progenitor-age dependence of SN Ia luminosity is corrected. The best-fit parameters, however, are in {$\sim$} 2{$\mathsl{\sigma}$} tension with the standard values inferred from cosmic microwave background observations.},

  abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are explosions of white dwarf stars that facilitate exquisite measurements of cosmological expansion history, but improvements in accuracy and precision are hindered by observational biases. Of particular concern is the apparent difference in the corrected brightnesses of SNe Ia in different host galaxy environments. SNe Ia in more massive, passive, older environments appear brighter after having been standardized by their light-curve properties. The luminosity difference commonly takes the form of a step function. Recent works imply that environmental characteristics that trace the age of the stellar population in the vicinity of SNe show the largest steps. Here we use simulations of SN Ia populations to test the impact of using different tracers and investigate promising new models of the step. We test models with a total-to-selective dust extinction ratio {$\mathsl{R}\mathsl{V}$} that changes between young and old SN Ia host galaxies, as well as an intrinsic luminosity difference between SNe from young and old progenitors. The data are well replicated by a model driven by a galaxy-age varying {$\mathsl{R}\mathsl{V}$} and no intrinsic SN luminosity difference, and we find that specific star-formation rate measured locally to the SN is a relatively pure tracer of this galaxy age difference. We cannot rule out an intrinsic difference causing part of the observed step and show that if luminosity differences are caused by multiple drivers then no single environmental measurement is able to accurately trace them. We encourage the use of multiple tracers in luminosity corrections to negate this issue.},

  abstract = {We reanalyse observations of type Ia supernovae (SNe) and Cepheids used in the local determination of the Hubble constant and find strong evidence that SN standardisation in the calibration sample (galaxies with observed Cepheids) require a steeper slope of the colour correction than in the cosmological sample (galaxies in the Hubble flow). The colour correction in the calibration sample is consistent with being entirely due to an extinction correction due to dust with properties similar to that of the Milky Way (RB {$\approx$} 4.6 {$\pm$} 0.4) and there is no evidence for intrinsic scatter in the SN peak magnitudes. An immediate consequence of this finding is that the local measurement of the Hubble constant becomes dependent on the choice of SN reference colour, i.e., the colour of an unreddened SN. Specifically, the Hubble constant inferred from the same observations decreases gradually with the reference colour assumed in the SN standardisation. We recover the Hubble constant measured by SH0ES for the standard choice of reference colour (SALT2 colour parameter c = 0) while for a reference colour which coincides with the blue end of the observed SN colour distribution (c {$\approx$} -0.13), the Hubble constant from Planck observations of the CMB (assuming a flat {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmological model) is recovered. These results are intriguing in that they may provide an avenue for resolving the Hubble tension. However, since there is no obvious physical basis for the differences in colour corrections in the two SN samples, the origin of these require further investigations.},

  abstract = {Strongly lensed supernovae (SNe) can be detected as multiply imaged or highly magnified transients. In order to compare the performances of these two observational strategies, we calculate expected discovery rates as a function of survey depth in five grizy filters and for different classes of SNe (types Ia, IIP, IIL, Ibc, and IIn). We find that detections via magnification is the only effective strategy for relatively shallow pre-LSST (Large Synoptic Sky Survey) surveys. For survey depths about the LSST capacity, both strategies yield comparable numbers of lensed SNe. SN samples from the two methods are to a large extent independent and combining them increases detection rates by about 50 per cent. While the number of lensed SNe detectable via magnification saturates at the limiting magnitudes of LSST, detection rates of multiply imaged SN still go up drastically at increasing survey depth. Comparing potential discovery spaces, we find that lensed SNe found via image multiplicity exhibit longer time delays and larger image separations making them more suitable for cosmological constraints than their counterparts found via magnification. We provide useful fitting functions approximating the computed discovery rates for different SN classes and detection methods. We find that the Zwicky Transient Factory will find about two type Ia and four core-collapse lensed SNe per year at a limiting magnitude of 20.6 in the r band. Applying a hybrid method which combines searching for highly magnified or multiply imaged transients, we find that LSST will detect 89 type Ia and 254 core-collapse lensed SNe per year. In all cases, lensed core-collapsed SNe will be dominated by type IIn SNe contributing to 80 per cent of the total counts, although this prediction relies quite strongly on the adopted spectral templates for this class of SNe. Revisiting the case of the lensed SN iPTF16geu, we find that it is consistent within the 2{$\sigma$} contours of predicted redshifts and magnifications for the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory survey.},

  abstract = {The currently used standardisation of type Ia supernovae results in Hubble residuals whose physical origin is unaccounted for. This poses a limitation to the accuracy and precision of distances that can be derived from supernova observations. Here, we present a complete physical interpretation of the Hubble residuals based on a novel Bayesian hierarchical model of type Ia supernovae in which latent variables describing intrinsic and extrinsic (dust related) supernova properties originate from two populations. Fitting the model to SALT2 light curve parameters of supernovae in the Hubble flow we find strong (4{$\sigma$}) evidence for the presence of two overlapping, but distinct, populations differentiated primarily by their mean SALT2 shape parameter (stretch) x1. Supernovae from the population with predominantly slow decliners (higher average x1) are found to be intrinsically bluer (mean SALT2 colour c {$\approx$} -0.11) and twice as reddened by dust (mean reddening E(B - V ) {$\approx$} 0.10) than those from the opposite population dominated by fast decliners (lower average x1) with c {$\approx$} -0.04 and E(B - V ) {$\approx$} 0.05. The inferred extinction coefficient RB in both supernova populations follows a broad (scatter 0.9) distribution with a mean of 4.1 which coincides closely with the mean extinction law measured in the Milky Way. We also find that the supernova data favour a peaked (two-tailed) distribution of selective extinction E(B - V ) over the commonly adopted exponential model (one-tailed with maximum fixed at 0). Our model provides a complete explanation of the distribution of supernova light curve parameters in terms of extinction properties and the above-mentioned differences between the two populations, without the need for introducing any intrinsic scatter.},

  abstract = {We have analyzed the bivariate distribution of galaxies as a function of ultraviolet-optical colors and absolute magnitudes in the local universe. The sample consists of galaxies with redshifts and optical photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) main galaxy sample matched with detections in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) and far-ultraviolet (FUV) bands in the Medium Imaging Survey being carried out by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) satellite. In the (NUV-r)\_\{0.1\} vs. M\_\{r,0.1\} galaxy color-magnitude diagram, the galaxies separate into two well-defined blue and red sequences. The (NUV-r)\_\{0.1\} color distribution at each M\_\{r,0.1\} is not well fit by the sum of two Gaussians due to an excess of galaxies in between the two sequences. The peaks of both sequences become redder with increasing luminosity with a distinct blue peak visible up to M\_\{r,0.1\}\textbackslash sim-23. The r\_\{0.1\}-band luminosity functions vary systematically with color, with the faint end slope and characteristic luminosity gradually increasing with color. After correcting for attenuation due to dust, we find that approximately one quarter of the color variation along the blue sequence is due to dust with the remainder due to star formation history and metallicity. Finally, we present the distribution of galaxies as a function of specific star formation rate and stellar mass. The specific star formation rates imply that galaxies along the blue sequence progress from low mass galaxies with star formation rates that increase somewhat with time to more massive galaxies with a more or less constant star formation rate. Above a stellar mass of \textasciitilde 10\^10.5 M\_\{sun\}, galaxies with low ratios of current to past averaged star formation rate begin to dominate.},

  abstract = {When working with multimodal Bayesian posterior distributions, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms have difficulty moving between modes, and default variational or mode-based approximate inferences will understate posterior uncertainty. And, even if the most important modes can be found, it is difficult to evaluate their relative weights in the posterior. Here we propose an approach using parallel runs of MCMC, variational, or mode-based inference to hit as many modes or separated regions as possible and then combine these using Bayesian stacking, a scalable method for constructing a weighted average of distributions. The result from stacking efficiently samples from multimodal posterior distribution, minimizes cross validation prediction error, and represents the posterior uncertainty better than variational inference, but it is not necessarily equivalent, even asymptotically, to fully Bayesian inference. We present theoretical consistency with an example where the stacked inference approximates the true data generating process from the misspecified model and a non-mixing sampler, from which the predictive performance is better than full Bayesian inference, hence the multimodality can be considered a blessing rather than a curse under model misspecification. We demonstrate practical implementation in several model families: latent Dirichlet allocation, Gaussian process regression, hierarchical regression, horseshoe variable selection, and neural networks.},

  abstract = {Annealed importance sampling (AIS) and related algorithms are highly effective tools for marginal likelihood estimation, but are not fully differentiable due to the use of Metropolis-Hastings correction steps. Differentiability is a desirable property as it would admit the possibility of optimizing marginal likelihood as an objective using gradient-based methods. To this end, we propose Differentiable AIS (DAIS), a variant of AIS which ensures differentiability by abandoning the MetropolisHastings corrections. As a further advantage, DAIS allows for mini-batch gradients. We provide a detailed convergence analysis for Bayesian linear regression which goes beyond previous analyses by explicitly accounting for the sampler not having reached equilibrium. Using this analysis, we prove that DAIS is consistent in the full-batch setting and provide a sublinear convergence rate. Furthermore, motivated by the problem of learning from large-scale datasets, we study a stochastic variant of DAIS that uses mini-batch gradients. Surprisingly, stochastic DAIS can be arbitrarily bad due to a fundamental incompatibility between the goals of last-iterate convergence to the posterior and elimination of the accumulated stochastic error. This is in stark contrast with other settings such as gradient-based optimization and Langevin dynamics, where the effect of gradient noise can be washed out by taking smaller steps. This indicates that annealing-based marginal likelihood estimation with stochastic gradients may require new ideas.},
